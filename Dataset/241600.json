One child might be colorblind, another might have vertigo-- they could even be a dwarf. But that's OK, because no one is perfect, and you don't have to be to succeed.",

But I found blueprints for an awesome looking sword.  One more run, just to get enough gold to unlock that sword.   ------  11:31 PM  Dead, but I'm kinda glad because I can't wait to buy this sword.  (I could probably sleep an extra 30 minutes and take the 7:50 train to work. I'll bike fast.)  One more run, just to see if I can one-shot enemies now.   ------  11:50 PM  That was awesome. It only takes me one hit to kill those guys now, which means I'm getting gold twice as fast.  Also, I found the boss room!   One more run, just to see if upgraded defense gives me the edge I need over the boss.   ------  11:54 PM  Thank god that character is dead. She was wack.  There's no way anyone could play with everything upside down like that.   One more run, with a proper character.   ------  12:12 AM  %#*@!! SO CLOSE. One more hit and that boss was TOAST.  Wonder what happens when you beat him.   One more run. This is the one.   ------  12:20 AM  Ok. Not even gonna make it back to the boss room if I don't take it a bit slower than that.  One more run. THIS is the one.   ------  12:40 AM  BOOOOM! That was glorious. Slaughtered the boss and got soo much money. Enough to try out some of these runes I unlocked. Not sure what 'vampirism' does, but surely I'm a total beast now.   One more run.   ------  1:05 AM  Holy crap. HP regain on kill means longer runs, and more gold. Stack a few more of these vampirism runes and I WILL LIVE FOREVER!!!  Muah hah hah hahhhh!   ------  1:09 AM  Ok, still gotta be careful.  One more run. Relax a bit this time.   ------  1:40 AM  OMG so much gold and I found vampire gear! There's vampire gear. Let's try it o--  Ah crap, I need a little more gold to upgrade my max weight capacity first.   One more run. Just gotta grab 4325 gold and die so I can check this out.   ------  2:22 AM  Man, what an awesome run! I was unstoppable.  If I hadn't been so greedy I probably could have taken down the forest boss.  One more run, just to test out this vampire armor.   ------  2:45 AM  The forest is mine and after I spend this huge pile of gold I am gonna be an absolute monster.  Holy crap it's 2:45 AM. Alright.   One more-- it's not a 'run'-- just gotta see how strong my attack is now.   ------  3:12 AM  If this new sword will let me one-shot some of the enemies in The Maya, I can do this real quick for sure.  Not with this mage character though.   One sec...   ------  3:30 AM  Using magic actually seems kinda fun. Maybe I shouldn't have ignored all the magic stats. This pot of gold goes to them. Woahh a whole new part of the tree became available! What is that mystery class?! 3945 to unlock.  3945.   ------  3:40 AM  I definitely should not have wandered into that part of the castle. Yet.  3945.   ------  4:04 AM  The Maya is mine! I guess I'm supposed to go to battle in that scary underworld area now. Oh yeah, that class! Unlocked.   Gotta die real quick so I can test it out.   ------  4:26 AM  Made it further than I expected in the underworld. A few more gear upgrades should make it doable.  Holy crap I can play as a   dragon  ?!?!  This is gonna be awesome.   ------  4:34 AM   Weak.  Oh god. It's 4:30 AM.  I hate myself. ------  10/10 You'll learn to forgive yourself.",

            "review_text": "I don't typically write reviews, but Rogue Legacy for me is going to be an exception. Ill start off with the pros and cons and then give some of my final thoughts.   But first, I just logged into the game to play one run through and HOLY CRAP I BEAT THE GAME! Finally!!  Pros: +Fast paced, hack and slash, dungeon crawl +Simple mob combat +Very fun spells +Strategic and challenging boss fights +After you defeat a boss, the door unlocks so you can do a unique challenge fight +RPG elements (item upgrades, rune upgrades, castle upgrades) +Very wide character variety +Deaths bring you a selection from three random characters +Randomized character traits +Randomized levels after each death +Quirky and a fun story line +Weight - Yes, weight. It brings a special element and challenge. You can't just unlock the best gear and wear it. You have to make sure your character upgrades accordingly. +Difficulty starts at a standard. You can control it by adding runes, which I've found also gives you new and unseen levels to the dungeon +168 hours played and I just beat the final boss. I still have so many upgrades and blue prints to find. +In that, extremely high replay value  Cons: -Finding later tier (tier 4 and 5) gear is very difficult -Once you unlock enough upgrades to your castle, the grind can feel tedious. This doesn't happen for a very long time, though. -There are very annoying occurances at times due to bridge placement. I.E. when trying to escape a level by jumping up to a bridge and activating it, only to have the hit cause your character to fly into the upper room and then back to the lower room. Causing it to reset. I'm not sure if this is meant to be a challenge to the player or just poor placement.  This game will always be a favorite of mine. The control you have to either farm for gold or challenge yourself to get blueprints for gear, is amazing. I find it really fun to have a choice of random characters and I love all of the unique traits they can come with. Whether you are looking for a dungeon crawl to play casually, or challenge yourself with hardcore settings, this game can fit anyone's arsenal of games.  5/5",

            "review_text": "Let me begin by saying that this game was truly a welcome surprise, I expected not to like it and boy did it prove me wrong...  So, what is it ? Is it really a rogue like ??? oh sure, in a sense... I mean there is no real save and you restart your adventures in a procedurally created dungeon every time... on the other hand not really because you actually do improve each time over and thats a fundamental no-no for rogue likes....  At the end of the day its a hybrid, that will appeal more to non rogue-like fanatics, rather than the true fans of that genre.  The thing is that if you look past all that, its a truly fast paced, fun-filled plat-former that will make you swear, cry and smile every-time you give it a go and believe me you will give it a go and another and another and so on... its so compelling to just try to do a bit better each time.  The main concept of the game is that each time you die you can start over with one of your descendants all of whom carry over the abilities of their ancestors (and their flaws). So you gather money with each run and but abilities and equipment and each generation is a bit stronger - mind you you cant keep your gold (or at least most of it) between runs, since you need pay death each time you enter the dungeon (except in cases where you have found a special item that you turn on instead of gold).  A similarity to rogue like games is that it starts out very hard and that will frustrate most players (but you will come back for more). However as you progress and improve it becomes easier and I must say (this is one of my grievances with it) after a point it becomes, perhaps too easy.  The bosses are somewhat easy (with the exception of the four special bosses that are insanely hard - but those are not necessary to finish the game) and each new play-through increases the difficult (ala Dark Souls New Game +1 ect).  One thing that ticked me off, which becomes apparent when you master it, is that it is actually short and it really makes you yearn for more.... perhaps with some expansion or dlc but you would like to do more much more (and this is another point where it differs dramatically with true rogue-likes).  The graphics are pix-elated but beautiful and the retro style suits it so well, the music can get a tad annoying at times but then again its very reminiscent of 8-bit era game music.  Overall I have to say I loved the game and I truly wish it had more to offer, but it doesn't. Is it worth playing in spite of that ? Hell yes - its so much fun....  But after 5 play-throughs and all achievements equipment the only thing left was the special bosses. I did spent the time to kill one of them but its for the true hardcores... perhaps I may go back and try them again for the achievements alone, but at this stage there isn't a lot of re-playability.  Again, regardless of any shortcoming I described, its so much fun and totally worth it (which is why its a bit disappointing at the end).",

            "review_text": "At first, this game is very entertainting. The combat is fast-paced, you can upgrade your character however you want, and the character descendants are often humorous.  But after a few hours, it gets *extremely* repetetive. The game's hook is that you will die, and you WILL indeed die A LOT. I thought games had evolved past the 3-decade old idiocy of being 'touched' by anything hurts you, but apparently this game didn't get the memo. Often you are surrounded by half a dozen monsters, which means dozens of projectiles flying at you and even more chances to get 'touched' by monsters. Ranged attacks would help greatly but mana is so limited for even the most basic of ranged attacks that you can't rely on it. So you're forced to melee most of the time against projectiles flying all over the screen. It makes for a very frustrating experience. So you die. And then die some more.  Dying often could be forgiveable if you're progressing. However, in this game, you are literally playing the same level over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. It gets old fast. The only way to progress is to grind the same level repeatedly for gold, while memorizing enemies. But with limited HP and each hit taking so much HP away, not to mention the annoyance of accidental 'touches' as described previously, you'll die often no matter what you do.  The upgrade system seemed really great at first, but every time you upgrade your character the price of all other upgrades increases. Essentially the carrot in front of your nose is being moved farther and farther every time.  Not only that, but every time you die, you have to give up all your gold before restarting the level. So you have 1000 gold and spend 500 on an upgrade, with the next cheapest upgrade at 510? Too bad, you have to completely waste the rest. Idiotic beyond belief. After a while, all the upgrades become so expensive that if you don't farm thousands of gold before an accidental death, you have to give it all up and you just made 0 progress. After a few hours, the game expects you to play perfectly, or you won't progress at all.  I was indeed getting really good at the end of my play time and really memorizing all the enemies and how they moved. But then I took a step back and realized that I wasn't having fun any more. Because of the extreme repetition in this game and the frustrating nature of combat, I would certainly give this game a DO NOT BUY. I bought this on sale for $2.99 and wish I could get my money back.",

            "review_text": "This is a good rogue like game that has an interesting progression system.   This progression system is really one of the key reason why I put so many hours into this game. Most rogue like games have perma death. Where if you lose thats it, its done you start from the beginning. Personally I did not like the idea of perma death in my games. I like to feel like I am working towards something and not losing everything just to try to do it again. With this said, many people who like rogue like games will disagree whole heartily with my decision and I understand that. Well with this game people get a little bit of both worlds.   This game has perma death and progression. Each character that goes into that death trap of a castle will eventually die but his or her's gold will be sent to their child where he or she can spend it on upgrades to their castle (that supplies skills, armory, stats etc) and to buy armor, accessories and even lock the previous dungeon so you can attempt it again. Then that child will die and send it's money to the next child and so on. So people get their perma death and progression all in one.   The gameplay is fun with platformer elements to it as well as rpg. Its a 2d side scroller where you go around in a randomly generated dungeon looting for gold, trying to survive and fighting bosses. Thanks to the option to lock the previous dungeon you can keep retrying the bosses again and again, without searching for the boss door. Which is nice because the bosses can be extremely hard if your not prepared. Also the dungeon itself is hard as well and you will find that it will take many attempts before finding the boss doors.   So overall, the progression system as well as the gameplay makes for an addicting game. With this said, their are a few issues I have with the game. When your character dies you get a selection of three (maybe four) randomly generated characters to choose from. All of these characters have different classes, special attacks and/or different qualities. Although the qualities like vertigo can really mess with you, most of the other qualities are forgettable after a while but it does add another element to the game at times. The random generated abilities on the other hand, were for the most part useless because most of the classes (except maybe mage and spell sword) had very little Mp to work with. I found that the normal attacks were sufficient in getting me through the dungeons. It could have really helped if the characters had a bigger Mp pool to work with and maybe some different spells and abilities.   Overall, good game with a few issues with the characters abilities, still very fun to play and has a game plus mode so good replayability as well.",

            "review_text": "The concept of this game is excellent, but once you get up to (and past) the first boss, it all feels kind of pointless:  1. Everytime you purchase an upgrade the other upgrades become 10 gold more expensive. So if you have a bad run, you spend your gold so its not wasted (the game takes your money when you re-enter the castle)-- and then the expensive upgrades that you DO want are just that much further out of your reach.  2. The randomly generated castle is an artificial thing meant to extend the game's lifespan. You can learn about the (small) handfull of enemies in each area, but you'll spend 90% of your time in the first two zones, over and over, just trying to progress. Progression is stunted even further by the game's general concept. You get just a LITTLE bit further each time, or the castle generates a room full of spikes and you take 75% of your health in damage before getting anywhere. Better get used to that first room, mate, because those four candlestick holders and that chair are always gonna be there for you to hit every. Single. Time.  3. Bosses are bullet-hell creatures. Given this game's 'tough but fair' philosophy and how easy it is to die, this was completely out of left field. The sudden difficulty ramp when it comes to killing any of the bosses will be like crashing into a brick wall, and made even worse if you're using a keyboard. The game only has five bosses, and rightly so considering how it all works, but the sudden spike in difficulty is not only unwelcome but punishing to the unwary gamer. I like difficulty so it's not a cakewalk, but I don't apprieciate having almost no chance at all. This is a cartoonish platformer, not Dark Souls.  4. No difficulty adjustment.   5. You can't use a mouse on any of the menus, which just FEELS wierd.  =-=-=-=-=  Don't get me wrong, I liked this game a lot when I first got it, but I'll never be able to finish it. The constant grind-grind-grind for gold with almost nothing to show for it 80% of the time, coupled with the VERY difficult boss fights make this game a little too hard for a casual gamer like myself. Games are about fun to me, and if my game becomes an endless loop with no progress it stops being fun. :(",

The perma-death aspect reminds me of RotMG, which I used to play, except you get to keep equips and upgrades which is more or less your progress. The maps are randomized, and sometimes you can find fun or rewarding bonus rooms, which is always a nice surprise and cool/funny.. I like how you are always switching characters so you have to adjust your playstyle differently for each run. So many tiny features like these that make the game fun and rewarding.

Between the two the game slowly becomes managable.  Very very few of the deaths feel cheap. Even when you enter a room and suddenly are beset on all sides and death comes within moments, even then the death rarely feels more than momentarily frustrating.  I couldn't recommend more. As good an indie game as there ever was. The devs did a magnificient job both on depth of content and fun. I'm nearly thirty hours into it and feel like I'm probably only half way. Crazy for a game that cost me nearly nothing on a sale, and particularly for one that I have enjoyed so much. One of the best games I have played in years.  FYI: I played the first five hours with just the keyboard then decided to try with a controller. It is worlds better with a controller.",

Both the world and the player character change each time - within set patterns - and alongside that, there is also an external progression and levelling up structure of unlockables to add to each time (as long as you played well enough).   So you get the immediate changes from character traits and level layout each time, combined with an overall feeling of progression to keep you coming back.  I'm surprised my total time playing this game is so short. I think it's because I'm generally playing it in short bursts.  It feels tough, but doable - if not immediately, then with further playthroughs. It's extremely rewarding when you finally manage to accomplish something difficult.  Also, most stupidly inclusive game ever. Love it.",

            "review_text": "Note: I posted an update at the end. I wrote my original review after a few hours of gameplay. The update is after 18 hours and changes my opinion on the game somewhat.   This is a really fun game. I've been hooked on it the last two or three days. You start with one hero and you venture off into the castle. The layout is randomized each time you play. You fight enemies, leap over spikes, the usual platform game challenges. I don't really like platform games, but this has become an exception. I'm not very skilled with these types of games and my character dies A LOT. But every time you run through the game, you collect money, runes, and equipment to build yourself up. You also gain levels which appears to boost hp/mp.   When you lose, you start again, purchasing your upgrades, then venturing into a new castle totally unlike the one you last explored. There's an option to lock them down (for a 40% cut in gold intake), but it means that when you go back in any treasure chests you opened are already used, so you have to explore deeper to find new treasure. Each time you start again, you choose a new hero, which can range from spell casters to strong melee to heavy armor/high hp, to low hp spelunkers that reveal chests on the map. It's a nice variety. Also, some of the characters have status effects like 'colorblind' where the levels are black and white, which can add challenge by making it more difficult to separate some enemies from the backgrounds. There is also near-sightedness which creates a blur on the screen outside a certain range of vision. There's even one that makes you play the game upside-down. I tried that one once and avoid it at all costs now.   I think the main draw of this game is that you can load this up with the intention of killing 20-30 minutes and it's still fun 2 hours later. It can be frustrating though. With randomized layouts, some rounds are going to be significantly more difficult than others. Fairy Chest rooms are the worst, sometimes having rules that just don't make sense like 'no jumping' when the entire room is a series of platforms over spikes. Even if you run through the spikes, you still need to jump out of them at the end. Maybe there are runes to overcome this that I will find later.   As you upgrade your character, the gold cost of upgrades naturally increases. I'd imagine at some point this cost will become excessive, as I am already struggling to bring in enough gold for some upgrades as it is. The worst part is that you have to use your gold or lose it before reentering the castle. You have to give up any remaining gold you have to enter, so if the cheapest upgrade you have access to is 650 gold and you have 640, goodbye all 640 gold. You can reduce this toll but it costs a lot to upgrade and it appears the max is probably going to be a 30% reduction. I've only done 1/5 reductions. They don't really seem worth it, so I've been investing in more useful upgrades.   The music is good, the layouts are interesting, the game is challenging. There isn't much in terms of story. You uncover short journals as you progress. It's fine that the game is lacking in story, however. It's not the point of the game. It keeps you going with the action non-stop (except for selecting your upgrades).   Lastly, boss battles seem disproportionately difficult for the rest of the game. I'm level 60 or so now and it's getting pretty easy to clear the castle (even for someone who is terrible at these types of games), but the bosses are much much stronger than anything else you encounter.  Update: After playing for 18 hours, I've pretty much burned out on this game. All I do at this point is run dungeons over and over and over collecting money to spend on upgrades, so that hopefully I'll one day beat bosses outside the first area (the castle). The costs on everything keep going up, so it's an incredibly slow grind to unlock the incredibly large amount of upgrades. On top of that, after 18 hours I'm only level 150. I've read that the level cap is just over 500. Assuming that exp to level up increases per level, it would take 60+ hours to reach level 500. That is way too much of a time investment into grinding. I never minded putting large amounts of hours into games like Final Fantasy 7, for example, because at least you're progressing through a story at the same time. Rogue Legacy has no story.   Do I still recommend this game? Sure. I did enjoy it for 18 hours. That's a nice turnaround on a $5 game (on sale). If you're looking for a game you'll finish, however, this one probably isn't it.",

Landing behind him, she slashed into his thigh. Botis was unfazed, and launched gusts of air at the the paladin. Quickly, she hefted up her shield and blocked the attack. Sensing a pause in his onslaught, the paladin swiped again at the giant's leg. Botis fell. After hoarding the treasure, she left the room to go fight more monsters. And then fell into a pit of spikes and died. She handed her birthright to Sir Gray, the dislecxic mage iwth irritable bowel syndrome.  This game is as silly as it is challenging. It's a procedurally generated metroidvania platformer with a quirky style. And even though I am not very good at it, I enjoy it immensely.",

I did eventually find a combo that worked for me (they kindly allow full rebinding of keys).  Rogue Legacy is a very addictive very fun game made in the tradition of Metroidvania 2-D style games. It offers a wide variety of monsters to fight each with their own creative way of trying to kill you. And you will die... a lot. With each death you get to select a new 'heir' from three options each with different abilities which can either help you or give you a lot of extra challange or just change the way the map looks.  As you progress you'll earn gold to upgrade your stats (which are not lost on death) and even unlock new character types from the standard mage to the less standard ninja.  What I really enjoy is that the creators didn't take themselves overly seriously. They were serious enough to make a game that is fun, but with gleefully silly nature that makes me smile when I play it.  I'm put in mind of Broforce a lot because you can get through a run in either game pretty quickly which is great if you have 15 minutes you want to kill and not commit to a game that demands hours. Though in both games I have spent hours playing it...  Bottom line, it's a fun game to play at your leisure. If it comes up on sale, pick it up and enjoy.   Addditional Statement: Well I finally beat the game. It only took just under 24 hours and 205 characters (the game kindly informed me this). I won't spoil it for you, but it's actually a pretty neat twist considering how this game is pretty light on the story. If you've been paying attention to the journal entries you collect you'll probably figure it out.  Now I just have to beat the game all over again. Fortunately they let me keep all my stats.  I have to say having completed the game, I had a lot of fun and certainly got my money's worth and hope the developers one day make a sequel.",

Then when you die after, you always have 3 children to choose from. When you die, you don't have to completely restart. You keep all your equipment, and all the points you spent on the manor (your perks such as more health, more mana, attack power up, etc.) So you level up with each point in the manor. Now, the gameplay. You basically can move and jump and slash and cast spells to kill enemies. Pretty simple. You can also have a smithy who has the equipment *note: you must find blueprints for your smithy to be able to make it, then you buy it.* The enchantress can enchant your equipment with runes to give extra bonuses and power ups. *note: you must also find the runes yourself.* There's a lot more to the game, but that's all I can explain now.

(I haven't tried it with keyboard and mouse, 2D sidescrollers aren't really built for that I think.)  * The level progression is pretty much perfectly balanced. You will level up after more or less every run, just enough to make you notice the difference but not so much that it gets too easy.  * The rooms are reoccuring, so you get to recognise most of them and learn how to best handle them. But they may contain different enemies at different times, and the order in which you find them are procedurally generated.  * You will probably want to grind some levels at some point, having trouble with a boss or something. But it rarely, if ever, feels like grinding. The different classes, spells, and special traits helps keep things interesting, especially combined with the fact that you will earn levels fairly quickly. (In the later stages of the game I usually earned 3-5 levels per run.)  * You might think it is too hard during the first 30-60 minutes or so, especially if you happen to run into the most challening rooms from the start. But then you start learning the controls and how enemies move, and you start leveling up, and then it is just great and addictive fun!  * I bought this on sale, along with like 50 other games or something. I haven't even tried the other games yet - I just could not stop playing this one. I almost wish I had paid full price, just to support the creators.   * When I'm writing this, nearly 10% of all Rogue Legacy-players have the achievement for completing the game - twice.

The genetic traits aspect of the game is pretty good, although there's a limited set of traits and some of them are not really affecting anything (at least to my knowledge). The latest update (Dec. 2013) introduced some new traits and content, so I expect more to come in the future.  The combination of RPG elements (equipment, runes, upgrades), proceduraly generated levels and the mechanics of traits makes this a really enjoyable game. Highly recommended.",

This masterpiece of a game brings back the brutal difficulty from the 80s/90s era inside our computers, but every single time you die is your own fault. The controls are very responsive and you have a gigantic array of possible upgrades and customizations for your hero. This game allows you to choose from 3 different heroes (different selection, every respawn) every time you die, and each one of these has some usefull skills, aswell as some 'traits', to balance the whole thing; the amazing fact is that most of these are really funny ones, and the combinations are endless, so variety is a big deal in this game. You need to invest a lot of time and effort in this game, but once you finish a boss you really feel rewarded.  Pros: - Challenging - Unexpected Humor - Very Deep Character Cutomization - Randomly generated level layouts (So infinite possibilities) - 'Traits' are fun, and force the player to play with a specific style, each time - Lovely 16 bits graphics  To note: - It's a rogue-like...so you have to like this formula to enjoy the game - Really frustrating at the beginning - Needs a lot of time and effort to complete  Cons: - Only 4 environments  Recommended to wake up our gaming skills, unused because of modern games low difficulty.",

Every run, you try to get money to upgrade your stats and equipment, which is made through killing enemies, destroying crates and lamps, and finding treasure chests. Every time you die, the castle shifts so you can re-enter it and find new chests, or kill more enemies for more money.  This game is fun as its challenging but not difficult. There are parts that one may rage (as I did often), but nevertheless have fun. Even dying isn't as bad as it seems, as you get 3 more options of knights that you can play as on a new run.

RL is considered to be a Rogue Lite, as the game allows the player to gain experience/gold to spend on tech tree upgrades or armor upgrades. It uses an RNG to generate the castle map and enemy layouts and does create some creative ways to kill you. The upside? You can HIT the enemies 100% of the time! This simple idea, whose origins began BEFORE Super Mario Bros. and Castlevania... and somehow... escaped the two guys that made FTL is -I must say- pretty darn satisfying. Who knew that an attack system based on simple spatial awareness could be so...intuitive and enjoyable.  Also when enemies attack you, you can...dodge.  'Dodge?' you say, 'Sounds like some fool's flim-flamery to me!'  I assure you dear sir, or madam, that it is entirely genuine. When an enemy attacks the player's character you use the controller to move out of the way of the incoming projectile and thus, negate any damage.  'And what of these enemies? I suppose in the interim of this electronic experience I'm forced to grind these scallywags.'  You may sir, you...may. You see, the point of Rogue Legacy is exploration, loot chests, and boss battles. You may kill them and receive a modest reward or avoid them entirely. Unlike FTL, the enemies are an obstacle not a resource.  'Well I say, this is starting to sound like a rummy good time.'  I assure you it is. The graphics are pixel artwork and actual care has been taken to achieve a certain asthetic appeal. No longer do you shamble blobby vaguely human crew members about a static background (like FTL) but a valiant knight, mage, assassin and many more characters each with their own playstyle, pros and cons.  The story is a simple one, but it actually exists (unlike FTL). You play an adventurer searching a castle to find a lost prince and slay the monsters that dwell within. Everytime the character dies, decendants are generated to pick up the quest. Exploration reveals notes by the lost prince that shed light on the story, answering questions and eluding to new questions.  Death comes swiftly for any faint-hearted adventurer but the gold you have collected is used to help increase stats like health, mana, weapon and magic damage. Or, use it to buy better gear and weapons for the sons and daughters that come after. The game is filled with dead-pan humor and a lot of the messages and even some player traits will produce a gaffaw or two.  One minor criticism are the controls are a bit on the floaty side. Your character lacks weight and also the hit boxes can be a bit...vague. I don't believe the game has true analog. The player can only run at full speed which can and does get frustrating at times. Though these aren't enough to detract from the game, in this humble critic's opinion.  Pick it up in the steam shop. Full price and you'll still be satisfied, catch it on sale and it's a steal.",

The aspects of your character and manipulating your chances for the strongest soldier possible creates great possibilities. Finding what you're best with is great fun. Then occasionally challenging yourself with the goofy abilities is a good time.  Only gripe is that the variety in enemies is a bit low, moreover the bosses are really just riffs on them. I would have liked to see more unique enemies that weren't just more powerful ones of the previous ones.  There is a certain strength in the familiarity of the enemies--it provides a cool basis to attack each area.  Either way, fantastic game and is a must play at its price range. I rate games based on what they set out to achieve. Below I categorized the game by what I felt it strived to accomplish and some things that are important in similar games. I believe games should be rated in relation to their genre, what they set out to offer new, and technical implementation.  World Building - This games world is an integral part of the gameplay, how it is formed is a huge piece of its enjoyment. The RNG is fair, fresh, and challening and I could play hour after hour. 1/1  Challenge - Like other rogues, difficulty goes hand in hand with this game. Presented in its enemies and boss encounters it was considerably difficult. That said, the challenge was a bit stale by the end and I simply wanted to move on or face new challenges. .8/1  Character Building - Rogue legacy's best aspect is how it handles permadeath and is very well handled. The variety is huge and once I thought I had everything unlocked there was more to get. 1/1  Replayabaility - Rogue's tend to be replayable and this is where I find this game a bit lacking. You can unlock everything in one playthrough and nothing stops you from just grinding out all unlocks. That being said, unlocking everything takes a long time and you will specialize in a playthrough. .7/1  The Je Ne Sais Quoi - Rogue Legacy has an addictive personality and the presentation is top notch. It embraces its inspirations--ghost and goblins, castlevania, and so on--and puts them all together in a well polished package. i would have liked to see more risk with the enemies but I still enjoyed all the fights. .9/1  Technical Performance - I don't think I encountered a single bug. Game ran perfectly as well. Controls were perfect using a 360 controller. 1/1  Overall: 5.4/6 -- 90%",

Rogue Legacy is a brutally hard mixture of different metroidvania, roguelike, and rpg games, you will die and you will love it.  The game does feature permadeath, the progress you made on your character is lost, but Rogue Legacy takes a neat spin on the concept. Any gold you gain is kept and passed on to your descendant. Gold can be used to purchase stat upgrades, new equipment, and even new classes. In this way, the game never feels repetitive, every hero inches closer and closer to defeating a boss; the game does a great job of pushing you to play just one more time.  Not every child has it easier though, randomized traits makes each one feel unique. You can play everything from a gay, colorblind Assassin to a hypochondriatic Archmage that suffers from vertigo. Each class has a unique ability, but combat in the game is still rather basic. The controls are very tight, and while the game is fairly balenced, it can be very challenging to the point of masochism.

I was getting slaughtered so badly that I stopped playing and put it in my 'backlog' list.  I came back to it last month to give it another try and I'm glad I did. This is not a forgiving game for those that just rush through platformers/bullet-hell games, or just jump at enemies to attack them without planning. You will get crushed, hard and often, and that it will be very frustrating.  If you take the time to approach each level properly, it is a challenge worth conquering. The randomly generated levels (except mini-boss and final boss levels) and maps and loot and extras means that it's an almost endless number of different play-throughs each time. This time, when I approached it with a different mind-set, I got hooked on this game in a bad way. I was playing it an hour or two every other night for a month, and finally starting making progress in the game, to the point where I just finished it last night. (Of course, you can jump right back in and continue playing in '+' mode (same format, difficulty cranked up), but I needed a break.)  Outside actually playing the levels and defeating the monsters/bosses/traps, the framework around this game gives you LOTS of variations on how to play it.  Multiple classes, multiple stat/class upgrades, multiple genetic traits (both positive &amp; negative), multiple armour/weapon slots, multiple upgrades for those items, multiple runes for those items...there are so many different ways to craft your character.   Finally, there is a lot of humourous touches in this game that show through in little places everywhere.  I would highly recommend this game, but only if you have patience and perseverance.",

Throughout the game, you can find and buy upgrades, which you get to keep even after your character dies and you start a new one (hence the 'Legacy' in the title). The game, like Mega Man, is brutally difficult at first, but once you get used to the controls, and upgrade your HP, mana, classes, and equipment, it becomes... well, only moderately difficult. (There's actually an item you can equip that depowers enemies at the cost of reduced gold drops!)  So why do I enjoy these games so much? Is it because I'm a masochist? Well, no, I'm not a masochist. (At least, I don't think I am!) I think it's actually because there's a sense of accomplishment that comes from pressing on and finally defeating the initial challenge of the game, making my character powerful enough to tackle the rest of the game. Then when I get to the grand finale, and the difficulty ramps up again, I can really appreciate how much I've progressed.'",

CONS:  Extremely difficult overall, somewhat repetitive, doesn't really have the 'loot' aspect you would expect from a dungeon crawl (not to the same extent of randomly generated items anyways), occasionally you'll be forced to play as a character with lousy attributes.",

            "review_text": "Wow, rogue legacy. If you're looking for a good time sync of a game that will leave you wanting to play more as soon as possible you've found one. The best way I would personally describe this game is as a 2d rogue-lite style game with random dungeon generation. One of the main things that may or may not put you off playing this game is the progression speed, at the start of the game, you're screwed. Everything you do at first will most likely result in your almost instant death, and believe me you will die a lot wither it be accidentally falling onto unseen spikes or not being able to master the patterns of some of the starting enemy's. The castle Is separated into four different areas, The Castle, The Garden, The Attic and The Darkness (or The Basement if you prefer) each one varying in difficulty and with each their own unique boss, which once defeated is not accessible by any other family descendants. As you progress through the game with your many different characters you will slowly learn more an more about the story of the castle that your family is trying to conquer through rare journal rooms which will give you a small bit of information each time found.  The way you will progress throughout this game is through gold. This will of course be used to buy varying and interesting upgrades for your family bloodline which can vary from your standard HP increase to upgrades such as 'Bestiality' Which can temporally turn you into a flying demon/human. Many different classes can also be bought further into the game with many different play-styles to use and master. Now once you set off into the castle the gatekeeper will take all of your descendants unspent gold (which can be upgraded so you can keep some of it upon entry). Once this is done you will have to hit everything that you can see to gain gold for upgrades weather it be chairs, chandeliers, mushrooms or monsters which at the start can be quite the challenge in of itself. Once dead the next of kin will inherent all of the money earned and be able to spend it on upgrades armor or enchanted runes that will give you awesome abilities. I think I should go a bit more into detail about the bloodlines. 90% of the time, like the real life, your characters wont be perfect each having something wrong with them. I find this to be one of the key things that keep me interested in this game as each different descendant will mix the game up more each time. While some will have illnesses that are not to uncommon to real life, other such thing may be quite weird and wacky such as the fear of chickens. I definitely find this element of the game good as not to make the game feel like much of a grind as it should. I also feel as if it adds some personality to each hero/heroine you play as each time, not making everyone the same and in perfect health like many so other games do.   While I do love this game ever so much it does have downsides that need to be taken into account. Some people do have this problem, some don't (personally I don't) but using a controller seems like the optimal way to play, as from what I've heard the keyboard layout is quite uncomfortable. Also, although it is randomly generated to an extent you will be getting used to the different rooms of the castle as rooms can (and most likely will be) used more than once in a run. This means that once you've learned how to deal with a type of rooms it can take away some of the challenge of the game. The final thing I'd say that is bad about is towards the end of the upgrade trees, it is one hell of a grind at that point potentially costing over 15 thousand gold for one health upgrade. This can really become quite ridiculous as I feel you can loose a lot of motivation at that point.  So my final words are that I find it to be a good very purchase at full price (£12) and would recommend that you get it as soon as humanly possible. Damn, it's a lot of fun. ",

You're guaranteed to die in the first 2-3 minutes after the tutorial for sure. And even after some upgrades, you will still die. The enemies just deal like 20-30 damage while you have 70-150 HP depending which class you're starting with and without traits. I would maybe like to see some kind of difficulty setting or a much slower difficulty progression, so that the gamer wouldn't die to the first room of skilljumping and spikes.  Graphics are very nice though. I like the pixel art a lot, and it showed well from the time I played.  However, the controls are... awkward, to say the least. You're better off right away change the default controls to something else (Left and Right arrow key moves, A is class skill, S or Spacebar is a jump, D is attack and W is using a spell. Q and E later on also dashes.) or maybe even using a controller. I can see this game go well with a controller.  All in all, it's a great game, but will frustrate you to the point where you might rage for the game being unfair. I wouldn't recommend this game simply because this game's difficulty is beyond casual gamer's skills. However, hardcore gamers will love the challenge.  6/10",

I got it on Steam in a bundle and I replayed it for a few hours just to make sure I my opinion hadn't changed.)  I love platformers, especially retro-inspired ones or ones with roglue-like elements. Most of my Steam library is made up of these types of games. They are my favorite genre. This game seems really great when you first start, it appears that there is so much to unlock and so much to explore, but the reality is that it never begins to fill one tenth of the potential it appears to have at the start of the game. Despite a couple novel ideas, the game quickly reveals itself to be a mediocre Metroidvania clone.  This game tries but fails to create a memorable new retro platformer. The controls are okay, though they don't feel as tight they should. Random level design can be great, just look at Spelunky, but the random designs in Rogue Legacy too often result in just plain bad layouts, platform and enemy layouts that seem unfair and are impossible to traverse without being hit, regardless of player skill. The other big problem with this game is that leveling up your character seems to have very little effect on his effectiveness in the dungeon. Even after 20+ hours, it's still very easy to die without progressing far at all. On top of this, the game punishes you for dying by making all your skills most expensive to purchase every time you enter the dungeon, whether your trip is successful or not. You grind and grind but your hard work never seems to pay off and this ultimately leads to a general feeling disappointment when you realize how shallow the game really is.   So what do you get when you put it all together? A platformer with bad level design, lots of really annoying enemies, and a character that's continuously weak and prone to dying. This game is hard for all the wrong reasons and none of the right ones. If you want some great Metroidvania action, skip this game and pick up Castle in the Darkness, it's less than half the price and more than ten times the game.",

            "review_text": "Congratulations to Rogue Legacy for missing the entire point of Rogue.  Rogue and its derivatives were one of the very few games where leveling systems made sense by virtue of using it as a resource that you needed to manage and by taking away your levels when you lost. Rogue Legacy manages to bork it up by making the leveling system not only PERMANENT, but completely external to the game play itself. There is no level resource to manage in each playthrough. Your equipment is set in stone from the beginning of each game. And each time you die, you get a little stronger.  So the way you succeed in this game is by DYING. What you learned from each death is much less important than the permanent +1 to strength you're going to get when you do. In fact, this makes dying DESIRABLE.  Hey game, if you're going to give me all these classes and levels eventually anyway, why are you making me go through the work of unlocking them? And while we're at it, how about you just set the difficulty to a reasonable level from the very start?  Oh yeah, that would violate the sacred tenet of gaming known as the 'leveling system.'  On top of that, the level layouts will deny you things by virtue of you having brought the wrong runes or by what random traits your new character has. Then when you pick those things you need, the RNG can just as easily not require them of you. What's the lesson here? '♥♥♥♥ you,' apparently.  But unfair BS is kind of the name of the game. You'll be put into plenty of unfair situations simply by virtue of how far you can see on your screen. You'll be put into expansive rooms where everything has projectile weaponry and fires at you all at once, but the game thinks this is okay because it has this mess of off screen indicators for you to try to parse. Is the high or low bullet going to enter the screen from the left first? Oops, never mind, that one top indicator was actually a stack of four arcing bullets indicators coming from an enemy you haven't yet seen. And god help you if your character views the world upside down.  You will spend hours and hours of unnecessary grinding in this game for no reason, and when you do succeed, you have no idea how much was your own improvement and how much was just the fact that your stats are so much higher than when you first started. It's especially weird that the developer thinks this is somehow related to Rogue. Rogue isn't the best game in the world, but it works because there is no permanent progression. Rogue Legacy reverses that, and tries to convince you it's because it wants everyone to beat the game eventually. But if you want to make a game where everyone wins, then just making losing impossible. Don't give me more stats until I win and then pretend it was me all along.  Rogue Legacy makes you grind out thousands of deaths to reach the difficulty level you should've had in the first place. It gives you so many crutches and helping hands along the way that by the end, it's patently obvious to you that your win has been gift-wrapped with a big red bow. And when the game tries to come back at the end to give you a pat on the back for doing such a good job... it's pretty disingenuous. Downright insulting, really.  If this was to be Rogue's legacy, I'd advocate for more birth control.",

The game is a real-time light roguelike with retro-style graphics and music where the goal is your basic dungeon crawling setup of complete the branches and bosses of the dungeon, then fight the primary antagonist.     The twist of the game is that you start off playing as a pretty generic character on you first attempt until said characted dies, then play as one of the character's three children for your next attempt, then one of that new character's children, blah blah blah, etc, etc. The complexity and uniqueness(not sure if that's a word) of the game comes from the various genetic traits that may be inherent in the children you pick. Traits, such as color blindness, ADHD, gigantism, are modeled off their real-life counterparts and give your characters various benifits or drawbacks, but often have a mix of both advantage and disadvantage. This feature causes you to very quickly develop an adaptable playstyle as you progress through the game, learning what traits are beneficial in what situations.     I enjoyed the variety and replayability that this feature provided and felt like it was one of the more original ideas I've ever come across in a roguelike.

At first i was worried that this would lead to just a pure grind, where i would farm gold until i had enough upgrades to beat the bosses. But Rogue Legacy is more clever than that, and manages to make every run satisfying for itself, a good platform/hack'n slash gameplay that reward good players with more loot. That way, you enjoy each run, but progressively you get ready for the boss encounters, which are the main steps of progression.  On the whole, the progression is really enjoyable. The game is very good at teaching you how to be better, by introducing new ennemies regularly. It's interesting to see that, at the beginning, the most dangerous areas of the dungeon seems full of unbeatable monsters, whereas once you've got some experience, you understand they are just evolutions of the enemies you've encountering before.  A negative point though: the upgrade system is not as flexible as would like it to be, or as it seemed at the beginning. By the mid-game it was becoming clear that i have to build/upgrade in a specific way if you want to be the most efficient. And that means many of the classes tend to be very weak, which is a bit sad when the game is advertised as you having to play with the random characters. In practice, you will understand that some classes are better than the others and favor theses ones.  The game will take about 20h to finish, and doesn't overstay its welcome. It was getting a bit repetitive in the end, and I'm glad it wasn't longer.  For people who really enjoy it and want more, the game offers unlimited replayability, in the form of infinite 'New Game +' mode, where each new game plus increases monster difficulty and rewards. However, the game will not offer you new stuff, just the same monsters with increased stats, so it will just be a game of grinding stats for your character.",

            "review_text": "I don't even know where to begin to start telling you about how awesome this game is.  This game is nintendo hard, at least when you first start out. There are no saves, no reloads. When your hero is dead, he's dead. The good news is that your descendents carry on when you pass. You get to choose from one of three descendents that will have various genetic characteristics; some characteristics are helpful (ADHD gives faster movement, while glaucoma makes it harder to see). There are runes you can add to your gear that can affect jump distance, give you the ability to float, and so on. There is also a fairly descent class/character progression. As your classes evolve they unlock new abilities. Couple all of this with the fact that castles are randomly generated and you have a game with TONS of replayability.   Now that I've told you about all of the fun stuff here's a list of things that could have been implemented to make the game far less grindy and even better. In order to progress you need to unlock gear/abilities/runes and the only way to do this is with gold. Skills and items are INCREIDBLY expensive and earning gold is slow. Every time your hero dies and you choose a descendent to take over, charon steals all of your gold when you go back into the castle. So when you are first starting out, if you don't earn enough gold to unlock anything, you'll lose it all when you go back in the castle. You can actually buy skills where you can bargain with the gate keeper - they are very expensive and the max amount of gold you can retain (when fully skillled) is only 50%. For the amount of gold the skills cost for bargain with death, the devs should have made the bonus be 100% for someone that's maxed out. Eventually, you can unlock classes that earn you more gold, but again, the skills are expensive. Overall this makes the game INCREDIBLY grindy. A few tweaks and the game could have been much less grindy, while still making gold challenging to earn.  Eventually, as you progress you can also unlock an architect. The architect allows you to enter the castle of your previous anscestor (lock the castle), but at a penalty of a 40% drop in the gold you earn. This wouldn't been so bad, but when you take this choice, the monsters respawn, while the chests do not. This could be improved by making it so that chests respawn, or monsters already defeated do NOT respawn.  This game is reminiscent of good old fashioned 8/16 bit sidescrolling hack and slashes. If old school 'ghosts n goblins' had a love child with 'castlevania' - their child would be Rogue Legacy.  Grinding aside, this is a great game and gets a 10/10. ",

            "review_text": "Rogue Legacy is awesome. A short description if you somehow don't know. It's an action platformer game in a castle whose layout is randomly generated. You run around swording dudes getting gold and loot. The cool bit is when you die you pick a new character from three choices, each of whom are given a random class, spell, and traits that could be benefits or drawback. Each character requires you to adjust your playstyle to match. You then have the opportunity to spend the gold you earned on character upgrades (these apply to every future character you get), new and better gear, and runes (these confer abilities like adding up to 6 air jumps) which can be swapped out for each character. Spend what you've got since the reaper will take all your gold (this can be reduced to half through upgrasdes) on your way into the castle, which is given a totally new layout.  I've spent about sixty hours in the game now. The thing that hooks me the most is that Rogue Legacy is one of the best playing games I've ever played. The controls are as responsive as they come, on par with a Super Meatboy (without the momentum model), but the way it controls includes a lot of gameplay nicities. You can move while swinging your sword, but damage is done when an enemy collides with your sword, not when you push the button. So for faster classes you can play fighting game style footsies with enemies by swinging, running forward to poke a dude then dashing back before he hits you. This can be further enhanced by character traits like flexible, which allows you to change directions while swinging. You can even dash in a direction your not facing giving you complete control over your mobility.  When you combine runes, classes, traits, and gear (some of which might favor spellcaster, or have added effects like +2 air jumps), every time you go into the castle you're going in with a different playstyle. The game then has massive difficulty scaling through its new game plus features and remix bosses. I've never beat a remix boss (they are so hard), but have beaten the game on NG+++++. I will unquestionably recommend this game. You'll get an amazing game with tons of replay value, its definitely worth the fifteen dollar ask.",

I don't normally play games like this so I thought it wouldn't be anything spectacular but I was so wrong, this game is extremely addicting and so much fun, it is a test to see how long you can live and how much money you can amass before dying and having to start again on your next character. There is a lot of customization in this game, like you can get armors with different stats and do different builds and playstyles and the dungeon is randomized every time, there is no beating this game, even if you beat every single boss then you move on to New Game + and the enemies get tougher. You do not beat this game, but you get better and tougher with every character and you have fun doing it. I thought this game looked kind of eh, I got it for $2.50 thinking it wouldn't really be worth it but this game is unbelievably great.",

But dont despair with death as you can play as one of your heirs over half a dozen classes with different abilities and classes and 'traits'. The traits range from dwarfism to ADHD, from OCD to short sightedness, and from dyslexia to being on roids (and a few more). These traits are made hilarious through the game and really add to the game - 'oh no im low on health and must search for some food - oh look a roast chicken - oh wait im scared of chicken so it somehow attacks me and i die. 10/10 would be murdered by chicken again'.  There are a few generic spells and most of the enemies are what you would expect to see - knights, warlocks, zombies, bone archers and mutant flowers.

The traits etc. are random, you can't somehow 'breed them out', so ignore that; it's just marketing spin.  2.

The humor in this game is fantastic, and the classic artwork of the castle will not get old before you have an rage induced violent episode. This game manages to be both very forgiving and back breakingly punishing; by that I mean that the first few deaths (they're inevitable unless you're the wiz) are mostly inconsequential, but as your lineage becomes larger... each death becomes progressively more punishing as you notice that skills are becoming increasingly expensive. At that point, if you're having a hard time with the game it will scale out of control really fast and you'll likely not have an opportunity to upgrade the first few levels.  All of that being said, this is simply remedied by starting a new legacy once you've gotten more in the groove of the game. The learning curve is not horribly steep, and once you figure out the game and the system you'll find yourself living significantly longer as your character literally farts along the screen.

Your character grows by leaving all of the gold they've gathered in the castle to their children, which they can spend on stat upgrades, equipment, and special runes that can give you abilities. Be warned though, until a certain upgrade is earned, you'll loose all of your unspent gold when entering the castle again (there's a skill that when a large sum of gold is invested into, you can keep upwards to 50% of your gold when going in the castle).  However, once one of your children decides to brave the castle, they'll find it isn't what their dad or mom went through. The castle randomizes its layout each time you enter, unless you pay to have the layout locked down at the cost of potential rewards (good if you decide to work on fighting a boss). This can definitely keep you interested while you throw your children into harm's way just so their children after them can have a few more hitpoints to survive the next area.  All in all, I've had a lot of fun with this game, and still play a bit on NG+ ever now and then. It may not be worth 15 bucks to a lot of people (though I think it is, but was lucky enough to get it as a gift), but if you see it on sale and want a Rogue-lite Castlevania-esque game, pick it up!",

It is true that permadeath is the name of the game here, but Rogue Legacy sets itself apart.   The first few times through you are going to die, and you are going to die a lot. But with each new attempt through you are going to make it farther, such is the case with every roguelike. The learning curve here is right on track, you learn the enemies' patterns and what to expect when you enter each new room. After about an hour of playtime you start to think 'I could use a little more,' and you find yourself a movement upgrade, as well as another class with some extra stat padding, and it gets a little better. You start working your way through the castle and eventually you beat your first boss, and it gets a lot better. You upgrade more, earn more classes, and you get hooked.  What this game has is a perfect rate of progression. Your skill and your upgrades combine to create a great experience, where skill is always needed even at higher levels, but the upgrades keep it from feeling stale and monotonous. In this game you are always going through the same basic steps. The rooms don't change much, you'll use all your classes many times, but it never feels the same. Every time through feels fresh, it is diverse where other roguelikes become repetitive. This is what Rogue Legacy offers.  If you are reading this review and have come this far, I would say your interest is great enough to warrant a purchase of this game. If you like character progression but a challenge at the same time, similar to the brand of Demon's Souls and Dark Souls, then you owe it to yourself to try this out.",

The first impression it made on me was that it would be a fun and quick little way to kill some time. I figured it would be a casual game. Boy was I wrong.  Pros: This game offers just enough challenge to keep me hitting the proverbial try again button while saying 'I know I can do better'. The random level generation works! So far I have never felt like I was just replaying the same thing (unless I wanted to ;) ).   Key mapping is also a great feature. I like being able to customize what keys control what movements.  I really like having the ability to re-enter the exact same castle layout. It is really handy for if I died too quickly, or I came across a spot that my current character couldn't enter. In fact, it's actually nice to see that the physical and personality quirks that each character has, not only adds some neat little dynamic to the next playthrough, but also can have a genuine use. While it's fun to run around as a gigantic barbarian, smashing all in my way repeatedly with my sword, sometimes, to access little hidden areas, I need to be the tiniest of men, or women, and I love that!  Another thing I like IS just the variety of character options! With so many classes, it's fun to play around with the various randomly generated character options. Even though they aren't given to you at the beginning, I feel it's actually better that way. I liked working to earn the coin to unlock them. However, I will admit that it was almost painful sometimes, when chosing what to unlock.  I really enjoy reading the journal entries and I can't wait to find out more of the back story. While it is agonizing to have to hand so much coin over to Charon at times, I understand the necessity. I think that the game did a great job explaining why it is present. An unlockable that you can get later on is really nice though and I admit I don't feel bad about haggling with Charon to keep some of my hard earned gold. (Honestly, best job in this game is Charon's XD )  The sound track is phenominal. In fact, I have actually started the game and just left it running so I could listen.  I'm a really big fan of pixel art and I have to say Rogue Legacy did a beautiful job with it. The characters and environments are nicely detailed and look fantastic.   Cons: I was led to believe that, while I could pick a new character from a selection of three options, I could also go back and pick one of my previous characters. I don't know, maybe I missed something, but I honestly thought I could go back and pick a character I had already played as. I understand why this is not an actual feature though, because it could be abused and defeat the purpose of playing as the 'child' of your now dead character. Still though, it was a little disappointing when I went back to play as Sir Taco II, only to find I couldn't.  Some of the descriptions on items that you can unlock, are either unclear, or too vague. I have used the gold I earned to purchase power ups that ended up not doing what I thought they would. For example, I was led to believe that through purchasing a certain power-up, I would be able to fly (aka pressing the action button would allow me to 'fly' upwards), if for a very limited amount of time. In truth, what I did was stay in place in the air for several seconds (which didn't help me when I was falling after attempting to make too large a jump, thinking that I would be able 'flap my wings' to reach it).  While most of the upgrades and power-ups boost general stats, some of them unlock other branches, which may contain playable classes. The problem is, sometimes the branch unlocked doesn't make any sense compared to what unlocked it. Unfortunately, I found myself having to put coins into things I didn't necessarily want, just so I could unlock a new branch and hopefully find a new playable class, or something else useful (which means I would have to just keep throwing myself at castle after castle for more gold, that I could spend on the new thing). Considering how difficult it can be to accumulate large sums of money, I didn't really like having to spend it on something I didn't feel a need for.  I think that while the enemies' increase in difficulty as you level up, works, the steep rise in how much it cost to unlock things seems kind of unfair. Especially compared to each coins individual worth. Sometimes I feel less like an adventuring hero out for glory and vengeance, and more like a peasant struggling to pay the resident lord.    Even though it may seem like I have a lot more negative criticism for the game, I truly do love it. This game can, through great will power (rarely frustration) on my part, be a casual quick time killer. However, I find myself coming back to it again and again because I keep telling myself 'I can make it this time', or I'm enticed by the promise of a new layout.  Needless to say my death count, or rather 'portrait count' is quite extensive.   I whole heartedly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a nice pixel-visual and musical accompanyment; and has the patience to die a thousand deaths.",

You feel stronger and feel like you get better at the game the longer you stay at the castle, but once you earn enough gold for an upgrade, nothing feels more satisfying then anything. Even if you die, your next child inherits the cash to spend. If you actually like how a castle is structured, you can use the architect to secure the castle, thus locking it until you are tried of the layout.

This is a bit like combatting an elephant by hurling pebbles at it. I could only successfully kill one of them and that's all I could take. If you do possess the mental fortitude to beat them all you'll be rewarded with a new special class. Highly recommend the game up until the remix bosses. Cheers yo.",

Even though you die alot on it, you don't really get penalized since it really just gives you a chance to level up by using your gold. I thought the game was a little too fast, so I play with it slowed down some since I believe that they programmed it with good relative speeds between the character and enemies, but then sped it up to make it seem harder. You could make many old action games this hard by speeding them up... This game is great bargin any way you play it. It has tons of different types of rooms and you can get some really hard stuff if certain combinations of enemies spawn together. Also, you get new game+ where you can replay the entire game on harder difficulty and then if you win, it lets you player another even harder version and this continues so that you could play this game forever and still find new challenges. There is no option to go back to easier mode, but you can easily edit 1 byte in the save file to set the game back to normal. They added extra versions of the bosses that are even harder and had you do them with preset characters for extra challenge. Lots of good stuff to keep you busy. I would only expect more goodness in future updates. I found this game to be much more fun than all of the high budget games that I have played for the last 10 years... This is the game to get!",

Fans of hack-and-slash games, dungeon crawlers, and RPG's alike will find themselves pouring hours and hours into this game. You explore a massive castle, with each new area revealing new enemies and evolutions of previous ones. You scour the castle for gold to upgrade your abilities in order to defeat the bosses in each area. When you die, you keep your gold, and your next character spends it on permanent upgrades like health and damage, new equipment (which you must find blueprints for in the castle) and 'runes' to attach to your equipment (which you also find in the castle, but must complete a challenge to obtain). However, you must spend your gold wisely, as you lose it all upon re-entering the castle! This is a great example of one of the many ways this game is brilliantly balanced. Another is the castle layouts. Each time you die, your next character explores a whole new layout. Unless, of course, you agree to give a percentage of your gold to one of the characters in front of the castle so that he can keep the layout the same! Finally, you do not get to choose your character and customize them complete. Instead, when you begin a new character, you can choose from one of three, each with their own unique traits and class and magic. This may sound like a bad thing, but it often instead leads you to discover the use of a class you have not used much, and how to deal with some of the more difficult traits in the game.  All in all, this is a game that will continue to draw you back death after death, Sometimes your best character will meet an untimely death, and sometimes your worst will make you the richest hero alive. Never knowing what will happen next is half the fun, and the further you get the less predictable things become, even as more abilities become available to you. While this game is quite challenging, I would recommend it to anyone, as it is a top-of-the-line model when it comes to games of any kind.",

That said, you can drop it at a moment's notice because it saves exactly where you are and what condition you're in, what monsters have been slain, rooms discovered, etc... It's grindy, but where I normally hate grinding I don't mind it at all in Rogue Legacy. Why? Because every life is a challenge to see if you can survive when the whole world seems like it's trying to kill you. Each new descendant, you make it a little farther (or fail miserably if you're unlucky or not used to the new character's class/traits). I found the game's story to be fun, too, even if it's not even close to a selling point or a focus at all during the game - mainly it's just an excuse to go along with the game - or lampshade and poke fun at tropes like food being found inside random objects.  It's a ton of fun, and a huge throwback to the games I grew up with. I highly recommend this one - especially if you can get it on sale. :D",

This is a rogue-like, randomly generated dungeon crawler that forces you to fight your way through rooms of enemies, solve puzzles to open chests, and defeat bosses in four sections of the castle.  The beauty of this game is that death is accepted, when you die you simply choose one of three randomly generated characters, cash in on the gold you found, and fight through another castle. At first you are likely to die many times without many kills, but as you learn the enemies and buy upgrades you will slowly find the game getting easier. Learning enemies is essential in this game. They will start out simple, but as you progress they get more difficult with more health, more shots fired, or new variations on enemies previously fought.  A good chunk of this game is about fighting to find treasure. You will mostly collect gold which can be used to buy more health, mana, armor; or you can buy new classes to play as, have a better chance to land a critical hit, or make your spells the hardest hitting in the land. You will also find armor and 'runes' (which will add more variety and strategy to each playthrough) in which you must purchase with the gold you earn.  As you select a new class to play you will find random traits your characters may have. Some may only be able to see in black and white, some may be flexible (allowing them to change direction mid-swing), or maybe they have terrible memories (good luck navigating without a map!). The spells you can cast are random as well, some spanning from a simple projectile, to a giant sword wall to keep enemies away.  Absolutely amazing, worth every penny! Controls are tight, graphics are that of the Super Nintendo era, with a great polish. The music can get a bit redundant, but never takes away from the game as most the time you will find yourself focused on not dying. I have heard there may be a secret room to take away from that problem, if you happen to find it, may I recommend 'The Fish and the Whale'. ENJOY!",

This is amplified when there are a ton of enemies on the screen and a lot going on.  I mean, he already swung his big fat heavy sword at me.. and missed. Shouldn't he be vulnerable?

However, every run through the shifting castle dungeon gets you a little further- any gold you earn can be used by your next character to purchase upgrades and gear. The game has a sort of heritage system, in each run you choose a child of your previous character, who can be one of several classes and may have any number of beneficial, harmful or completely benign medical conditions, another element of randomization atop the expected ones: randomized dungeon layout and loot. Character customization is extensive, with various gear setups of weapons and armor, and skill runes that add things like extra jumps or air dashes. I died many, many times over the course of my playthrough, especially during the very difficult (perhaps even cheap) boss fights, but unlike some roguelikes the game never really punishes you for that. You're even able to 'lock' the castle and reenter the same layout as your next character, expiditing your progress to say, a boss room. I found myself addicted to the game, wanting to go on 'just one more run' to get another upgrade before moving on to something else. The game has decent music and a charming art style as well, which clashes nicely with its rather grim lore. The game delivered strongly on that 'what's in the next room?!' factor that I love about these sorts of games, including action roguelikes like Diablo and its derivities. Rogue Legacy was persistently entertaining throughout and I can recommend it to most, even those who would normally shy away from a roguelike.",

It's ruthless and unforgiving and fun as hell. And it also has some of the finest humor i ever saw in games. There's a charecter called Charon that takes all of your money when you get into the castle again every time, so you can't stack up money from every round, and get OP in the first hour of gameplay. The gameplay itself is fun as hell, and you can get better armor and weapons and runes (skills) to improve your charecter the way you like.  Altough, it's really repetitive at times. For example: the soundtrack contains only ONE track for each area in the castle, and as nice as it sounds, it gets annoying after a while. Every time you get a new charecter and enter the Castle's yard, there's always that slight delay that your charecter stands there and doesn't let you move him. It's annoying doing this every time. Also if you get the architect, and talk to him, the exact same animations happen and the exact TEXT shows up. It lets you skip, but it's still annoying talking to NPC's and having to go through the text every time even though i knew what they said.  Overall, a fantastic game! 9\\10",

These upgrades persist, so you will slowly start beating enemies faster and it will take more hits to kill you.  There are several areas that have their own difficulty level. Each area has its own boss, and once you beat a boss, you won't have to beat him again. New, unique areas are generated on every playthrough. There is an option to play the area of your previous generation, but this will cost you 40% of your gold.

            "review_text": "Starts out really addicting, but at a certain point it becomes a grind for money in which to level up your character. Unlike other roguelikes that introduces new powerups and abilities as you progress, your character traits and abilities are set before entering the dungeons, castles, and outdoor areas. New abilities and armor upgrades can be found littered throughout the areas in the form of challenges and chest drops. Abilities come in the form of Runes and armor upgrades drop from certain chests.   While it's a good encentive to replay the game over and over again to find all upgrades, it unfortunately requires money to equip them, which increases in cost after each purchase.  Along the way you'll pick up some passive powerups such as ones that gives you more money drops or another that lets the player walk on spikes, but they rarely change up the gameplay and is active only on the current playthrough until found again on other playthroughs. Majority of the time you're using your sword to attack with the addition of a side weapon that uses MP points, very much like Castlevania games.   Enemies often repeat thoughtout each of the form areas. Their size, color, and health are different, usually increasing for the difficulty. The boss enemies of each area are large and require a lot of damage. While they're fun and challenging to fight, you'll spend most of your time to grind even before attempting to take them on again. And after defeating them the first time, the next time you want to take them on, they are stronger, faster, and have different movements. The game also forces the player to use a set character, but are given unlimited tries. In my opinion it's a poor choice to not allow the player to take on the original version of the boss. It makes most playthrough a money hunt and regular enemy whacking game.   Rogue Legacy is worthy of your time if you enjoy rogue-likes, but there are better ones out that reward the player better and have better incentives to keep playing.",

The controls are tight and responsive as they need to be for a game of this nature. They can be just a bit twitchy at times and fine control can take some practice. The gameplay is difficult and occasionally frustrating, but in a fun way.   The music is superb. It adds just the right atmosphere without being so imposing that it gets old. I've heard the intro to the main castle music probably 500 times and it still brings a smaile to my face.   The character traits offer a lot of diversity and the random dungeon layouts allow the player to experience the unfamiliar exploration phase of the game every life (unless they buy an upgrade that will let them keep the immediately prior layout for a large fraction of the next run-through's gold). I don't normally like the game mechanic of grinding for randomized loot, but the way it's integrated into Rogue Legacy makes it a charming and goofy quirk of the game's premise rather than just a rule that forces you to grind for grinding's sake as it is usually emplyed in games. That is a feat.  Bottom Line: Rogue Legacy is just plain fun. It's on par with the best of the sidescrollers of the 8- and 16-bit eras while being fresh and quirky in its own way.",

There are a few generic spells and most of the enemies are what you would expect to see - knights, warlocks, zombies, bone archers and mutant flowers.

I found myself taking more damage because I expected in to play a bit more Castlevania like. So I'd attack and then get hit by the enemy because of their or my trajectory. Just a minor annoyance. That and boss battle are hard! This whole game was hard!",

Although it is very fun, the upgrades get very expensive causing some runs to feel like a waste (you lose any unspent money.) Also, the controls are not perfect and many deaths felt cheap and caused me a lot of frustration. But overall, this game is highly recommended.  PROS + Brilliant upgrade and progression system + Exploring the castle is fun and exciting + Each run feels very different + Each character has random, game-altering (sometimes hilarious) traits + Lots of upgrades make progression fun and interesting + Charming characters, good graphics and sound  CONS - Controls are not perfect, even with a gamepad - Frequently felt like many deaths were cheap and beyond my control - Progression may seem too slow for some - Expensive upgrades render many runs a complete waste",

The game has a lot of random elements + a persistent element you slowly acumulate by finding tressure and by upgrading your castle with the earned cash from the previous run. This makes you stronger every run allowing you to move deeper in the castle with more ease. It also allows you to unlock more abilityes that can randomly generated by the begin of a new run.  The platforming and battle system is dificult but fair, if you get hit its becouse of our own fault, that makes the game so additicting to master ! :) great game hope this studio will make a second game with the same elements in the future!",

Seems ok enough only that everytime you die you lose your money and go right back into the dungeon that also changes each time you go in. So some runs you'll get lucky getting the right class and decent dungeon that you can survive without getting completely futt-bucked by every trap, enemy, and whatever else they throw at you.   So should I get this game is probably the question you're asking yourself. I'll ask you this; do you like hitting your head on a wall so much until you actually start making a a crack in it? Then that's the exact metaphor this game offers. It's very grindy no question about that and you will get frusturated especially if platforming is not your forte but if you're a gaming masochist that likes failing over and over and over and OVER again until you actually succeed, then that feeling of getting through and over-coming a challenge through all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t will give you the euphoria you're looking for. If platforming, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t RNG, and getting angry so often that you want to kick a baby over a field goal post, then don't get this game at all.  Overall I give it a 7.5/10",
