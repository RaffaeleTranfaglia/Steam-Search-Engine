It can get a little tedious with micro-management, but what other game allows the player to take the role as either the Rebel Alliance or Empire in a virtual sand-box galaxy where you can choose whatever you want to do? The game is a little dated graphics-wise, but it's otherwise really brought to life with the original voices of the original cast, the expanded universe references and the ships. Even though I already have the CD to this, I bought it on Steam both for the ability to just download and play, but also because I wanted to make sure I could play it on my Windows 7 machine. Overall, a great game for a very good price.",

The port does have a few problems, so listen up for what to do to play this game without the upside down icons, graphical glitches, or the infamous production selection not working.  Right click on Rebellion, go to Properties, and then set launch options to '-w' (this will open the game in windowed mode, thus fixing the upside down icons). Launch the game, and leave it in the top left corner and do NOT move it (moving it causing the production glitch bug). Should look normal, but the client is in the upper left corner.  After this, game plays as I remember it! I still recommend this title because that may not really be an issue for some people, and other than that the game is still fun.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: If you like Star Wars and strategy games and are willing to look past its age, buy this game.  Star Wars: Rebellion is an older title, but still one of the best in its class. No other Star Wars game has the level of depth and strategy as this. You have all the forces of the Empire or the Rebellion at your command, and it's up to you to lead them to victory. As its leader, it behooves you to strengthen your faction's military, industrial base, political support, and information networks in order to keep the war machine at full capacity. Few other games will make you feel like a master strategist as Star Wars: Rebellion.  Pros: + Broad-scale strategic gameplay that ranges across the entire galaxy + Deep mechanics for building, managing, and conquering your faction + Control famous characters like Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Darth Vader, and Emperor Palpatine + Command space battles with iconic Star Wars ships like Star Destroyers, TIE Fighters, X-Wings, and even Death Stars + A who's-who look into the Expanded Universe pre-Prequel Trilogy ; almost every unit, hero, planet, and building comes from the EU  Cons: - UI is a bit outdated - it's a very menu-based game with little in the way of keyboard shortcuts or other modern concessions - Some of the mechanics aren't explained well in-game, meaning you will have to consult resources outside the game to understand how everything works - Tactical depth of battles are lower than you might expect - space conflicts play out a bit slowly with a strange UI, while land battles happen completely behind the scenes without player input after the battle begins - Little optimization for modern hardware - you may need to do some work to get it to run on your machine. Running the game in compatibility mode helps a lot",

            "review_text": "Review Edited post patch:  Now that the game works properly, a review can commence without ire.  Overall the game was, for its time, a nice semi-real time Civ-like strategy set in the Star Wars universe, with the now defunct 'Legends' EU content mixed in. Its not a game one can play a few casual hours in, but one could definitely find themselves saying 'Another hour then I'll do something else...' only to find a day has passed realtime. There's a lot of resource management and strengths/weaknesses to each system/world owned. Its a case of complexity vs. depth, whereas some parts of the game are deep and others just overly complex. I could write a review on the mechanics alone but that would be an essay rather than a snapshot review, suffice to say there's a lot going on here and not all of it is great. My recommendation is, if you can get past the Windows 95 era graphics, you have a solid strategy/galactic management Star Wars game. Empire at War seems to have taken *some* notes from this game, and the similarities can be seen after a few hours of play (especially if one uses the Thrawn's Revenge mod for EaW). So 7.5/10 is the numbered score I'll rate it, very replayable but heavy on complexity. Not really for casual players due to the number of hours one would have to sink into the game per playthrough. My previous review was salty towards Steam for carrying it while it was in a poor working condition for most modern systems, the patch has changed that and so I decided to 'patch' my review in accordance. Still I believe games should never be released for sale unless they're in good working order, that stance will never change.",

            "review_text": "A good example of Star Wars gaming prior to the Prequels, to Disney's purchase of the IP, and the glut of Star Wars merch that resulted each time.  You can say that Rebellion ('Supremacy' on the other side of the Pond) predates both Sins Of A Solar Empire and Galactic Conquest mode from Star Wars: Empire At War as an RT4X game. Sins and EAW are obviously completely different animals, but let's look under the hood:  On one hand, Rebellion's mechanics, and more open-ended interpretation of what was then 21 years of Star Wars canon can convince players they're actually in overall command of the Alliance or the Empire. Every game starts mere days after the Battle of Yavin, and deep, non-linear gameplay lets you rewrite Star Wars history from there; you're building shipyards, factories, defenses, mines and refineries to supply your war effort; you're assigning beloved characters to command fleets, planetary garrisons, or on missions of diplomacy, sabotage, abduction or rescue. The randomized starting conditions of each game are the sprinkles on top.  On the other hand, Rebellion has a crappy UI, and is noticeably poorly balanced (some planetary bombardments, and rescue or sabotage missions often end up annoyingly ineffective humanitarian disasters). Don't expect comfort from your optional control of the needlessly emphasised space battles - they apparently have separate mechanics altogether, comperable to Masters Of Orion for all the wrong reasons.  Get Rebellion for its gravely overlooked place in the history of early Star Wars games, for its depth, and for its tiny, but damn persistant following; DON'T get it for its undercooked interface and design flaws.",

Moreover, to the fans on Star Wars and its 'expanded universe' (which is re-written due to the latest trilogy) it would be a nice addition. I lacks stuff like Eclipse Star Destroyer and land battles but I don't think they are huge losses.  What is more important in this game is the resource management and agent management which has a surprisingly steep learning curve. (some forum research is recommended) It does not have the complexity of the Paradox Games or the Tactical options of the Total War series or the faction selection of Civilization V but it still can hold its own using the 4X formula.   Recommended for lovers of Star Wars, Strategy games, oldies but goldies and 4X games. Not recommended for gamers who don't like some of these aspects.",

The Real-time space battles, though low in detail and seem primitive to todays standards, are still fun to do, especially with a Interdictor and a Death Star in the same battle!  Only thing I would like changed is a way to shut C-3PO up when he's giving the initial briefing.",
