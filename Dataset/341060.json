            "review_text": "One sentence: This game is hard. Hard as f*ck. (Actually, two sentences).  I must say that it's weird to make a review of this kind of game because... the game's mechanics are really simple, making you wonder if it is a game in itself. This isn't an horror game per se, but it is a kind of horror game. It seems contradictory, but it's not. There is a lot of different ''horror'' games, and this is one of them.  Let me explain: It's not... scary... it's spooky/freaky. Let me explain: This game is rich in visual and emotions. It makes you feel strange inside, and it breaks the fourth wall. The horror comes from your own emotions. The horror, is the weirdness that this game try to make you feel, and it succeeds, in my own opinion. There are levels in which you think that it's never going to end, or that you might never succeed. No matter how hard you try, you still feel helpless. The character is (You are) slow, the attacks are slow, so the ''freaky'' factor comes from the way you move. You are nothing in a ''fast'' moving world. The spooky factor comes from the atmosphere. The sounds are weird. The footsteps sounds are heavy, like if you had the burden of the world on you. Multiple noises comes from everywhere. And you ask yourself: ''What's the point?'' ''where do I go?'' ''What's the purpose of everything'' ''It seems so random''. This game is hard.   And when you wanna quit the game, you have one sentence saying: ''I can't go on like this... I give up.....''.  It think that this game's about depression, and how life can be hard for some. I'll try to make a full deep review of this game on youtube in French, and also in English and cover it from front to back. It deserve some praise because I think that this ''game'' is more a work of ''Art'' than an ''entertainment''. (Don't get me wrong, Art is a large word, but in this case, it is used to express ''a form of work that makes you feel diferrent emotions''). So I do recommend this experience, because it is a real ''charm' in it's genre.  Some will find this game frustrating... and yes it is. The NEGATIVE thing I have to say about it is that, sometime, (and it seems random) you have to start the game all over again. I am really disapointed in this, because I want to know more about it and my skills are really low in the 3rd (or 4th... not sure) and i am unable to fully get the whole narrative.  One of my friend bought me this game, because he wanted me to play and analyse it. And I will do a full coverage on it for sure! I am happy that some games are more than ''just a piece to entertain a mass''. The puzzles are weird, as they are not puzzles like ''Zelda'' or ''Myst'' or whatever other mainstream ''puzzle'' game (Don't get me wrong here, I appreciate mainstream games also). Pricing is also good. There are piece of s**t selling for 20-35$, and this game is less than 5$ for one of those experiences.",

            "review_text": "The Lady is... odd, to say the least. In some ways, it throws back to the games of yore, throwing you right into the thick of things without explaining much of anything, and leaving you to figure things out. It also eventually finds its way to vertical shooter 'boss' battles, to that effect. Its eerie art style and unique soundtrack seem specifically designed to put the player on edge, which works well enough.  Complaints about the gameplay seem to abound, but while figuring out the timing for certain things takes a certain amount of trial and error, it wasn't overly frustrating. Margin of error was also pretty narrow for some of the combat, but once I recognized the patterns you need to watch out for, it was less frustrating.  The game's narrative seems rather thin and/or muddled, but in some respects, I rather liked that aspect of it. Rather than laying down a clear story, The Lady leaves more than enough room for the player's imagination to run with things. My main takeaway is that the titular Lady was struggling with some personal issue; whether it's body image, her past, depression, or whatever else is up to you. To be fair, she could also have some issue with other women. Like I said, a lot of room to think about things, since nothing's all that clearly laid out.  When all's said and done, The Lady isn't exactly something that's going to change your world, but it was fun enough, and definitely found a little nook in my mind to occupy after I was done, making me wonder what things were all about. I'd say give it a chance.",

            "review_text": "The lady is a very disturbing game, and that's not a bad thing.  The atmosphere sets the mood for the game perfectly as it depicts the mental state of mind of the protagonist by the environments, design of the enemies and the sound effects, music.  The gameplay is pretty basic, but very difficult when it comes to it's puzzles, the dev himself has mentioned that he believes that a lot of people will get stuck on the second level puzzle which you can see in the end part of my first impression video here:          YouTube™ Video:  The Lady - A Quicky Look&nbsp;",

After viewing the store, watching the videos and reading the synopsis; I was nearly 100% that I would love this game. I was 110% wrong though. The art style is awesome and really is the only redeeming factor in the game. Honestly, if you look at the screenshots here; you will likely see everything and more than you would see playing the game.   The real reason for the negative review is the gameplay. I honestly have low expectations in general, but walking back and forth avoiding glass just wasn't enough to peak my interest. There are a handful of buttons which allow you to attack and move different directions but ultimately adds zero intrigue. After walking across the map for 30 minutes I can honestly and accurately classify this game as a loser.  Worth $0.25 to FREE. Cool art style, but the positives end there.      Accidently Reviewed",

            "review_text": "This game is the best example of why an artist shouldn't think that they're automatically capable of making video games.  The 'game' is very good in the art department. That is, it has well-drawn images and good sound. It is, however, very much lacking in every other aspect. The gameplay is very slow and mostly consists of dragging your character around the screen and getting to whatever exit while sometimes avoiding falling stuff. For the few points where gameplay progresses beyond that, the character can also fire shots in three directions, mostly to remove obstacles. This method of mechanics is self-limiting to an extent that at one point the game gives up with it entirely and decides that it's Galaxian (yes, it suddenly switches to a game of Galaxian), and after about 15-30 minutes it dispenses with everything and ends. That's right, this game is 30 minutes, tops.  All in all, I wouldn't recomend this unless you enjoy dragging characters around, and even then I'm sure there are walking simulators that last longer.",
