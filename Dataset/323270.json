            "review_text": "It’s a fair enough hidden object game, pretty standard as far as they go. Nothing too amazing about it but nothing all that bad either. I quite enjoyed it and I think if you’re a fan of the genre you will to.  The story is alright, it’s something you can follow but it’s not the most engrossing or thrilling. Also, I think it left on a cliff-hanger? I’m not entirely sure. I wasn’t paying all that much attention to be honest.   It’s quite short, took about 2 hours to complete. So if you want a nice quick game to play to kill a few hours this one is good for that.   In terms of art style/blending and all the other media,  There is no voice acting for one, but the music is quite relaxing. I found it mildly interesting that certain objects in the scenes make noises. Seeing as you can scroll your sight around the room in this game, it was quite handy a few times. For example, I needed to find a clock and I could hear a ticking coming from the far left of the room.  The art style is nice and the blending of objects can at times can be quite good. Was a few times I couldn’t find what I needed because it was blended in too well. I mean, it’s not amazing stuff but I’ve seen a lot worse.   All in all I think this one is neutral. I’m not going to leap at you to tell you to buy it now because it’s unmissable, I have no reason to really. But I also have no reason to tell you to stay clear of it.    TL;DR : It’s alright, pretty standard really. Only notable thing being that it’s only about 2 hours playtime.  ",
