I would think any reasonable person would understand the use of any RAM drive requires access to a chuck of spare RAM, and that initial load times are simply a part of the package….. -Go figure. For my part I’m running 32 GB RAM in a 3000 MHz Quad configuration so clearly this product is of interest to me: works beautifully. Loading a 12.4 GB game (BL2) to the Dimmdrive took only seconds, and did indeed provide higher FPS in testing. I also ran 3DMark from Dimmdrive and again saw improvement.  Because my system is entirely SSD based I wasn’t expecting a significant (i.e. quickly noticeable) increase in performance, but have and am expecting even better results during those short but noticeable periods of nasty-high drive access so many games seem to stumble with. Super easy to use (thank you, RAM Drives can be a total pain in the butt!), pricing seems reasonable, and it performs great. -rk.",

I was puzzled by this since I ran most modern games just fine but the ageing Fallout 3 was so sluggish (close to unplayable). IIRC the game was simply not optimized to utilize a newer computer. Anyway, Dmmdrive fixed it for me. Almost no loadtime between indoor and outdoor anymore, gameplay improved too. Very very noticeable.  I put 2/3 of Skyrim on Dimmdrive since I did not have enough RAM for the whole game. Now I think Skyrim is playable as it is but with the Dimmdrive I noticed improvements too.  I ran Firefox for a while on Dimmdrive and it was noticeably faster, which really surprised me. I ended up having some minor issues and quit using Firefox as my main browser anyway, but if you get a chance I would certainly try it out.  I think this might be an excellent buy for some.

            "review_text": "TLDR: For Skyrim with a lot of mods I see about a 30% increase in load speed using DimmDrive instead of my Raid 0 of SSDs. If you use a HDD and have a lot of RAM, get DimmDrive. If you have a TB of SSD space that runs at 1 GB/s, like mine, DimmDrive is less of a necessity.  Skyrim with RealVision ENB and the highest resolution version of all recommended mods for RealVision. I added my data folder to Dimmdrive. For the tests below, I opened Skyrim loaded a save to an outdoor cell and timed the load then closed skyrim and repeated two more times. The first numbers are the three load times, the second numbers are the disc access times according to Windows Process Monitor. Note: the 'disk' I'm using is a raid 0 of two SSDs, it benchmarks at about a GB/s sequential read. I did this multiple times in different areas. The below data is indicative of the results I'm not showing. I don't include them, so that I can keep this short.  With DimmDrive: 15.90 s , 14.02 s , 13.99 s  Process Monitor: 12.01 s for 13.4 GB total disk access  5.68 s disk access for 3.83 GB on the first run W/o DimmDrive: 22.83 s , 12.95 s , 13.03 s  Process Monitor: 23.83 s for 11.3 GB total disk access  23.8 s disk access for 5.2GB on the first run  Explanation:   For the first access of a cell (a room or outdoor area) DimmDrive is far superior for large disk accesses. Once the data has been cached in memory DimmDrive has a small amount of overhead that makes it slightly slower than straight ram access.  For general play I see about a 30% improvement in performance when disk access is a question.",

            "review_text": "After reading some of the most recent negative reviews, I must say that I am baffled (BIG BANG THEORY: 'BEFUDDLED' lol) as what users expectations are about this software. Allow me to enlighten (... and amaze ... lol) the un-initiated: it's a RAM-DISK Jim, it's not what we're used to ... (Jim, it's ALIVE ... lol) ... ANYWAY, all Star Trek jokes aside, YOU PEOPLE must understand that it is a RAM DRIVE (DISK DRIVE)! That's it! That's all there is to it! So, let's see, what do we do with disk drives ... ? Ah yes, we put stuff onto it (wow, I wonder if people are following this ... lol) It's a DISK-DRIVE in RAM (MEMORY), which means it's rediculously FAST! That's right: FAST! ... but only for loading files ... well, in your cases presumably game-files, presumably! Seriously, what else were you expecting? Of course, you must have a lot of RAM to start with, I would say at least 16GB so that you can have a 10GB RAM-DISK-DRIVE and the remaining 6GB for your system and whatever game you want to play. And of course you can adjust the AMOUNT of RAM usage to suit whatever game (or application) you wish to use. This doesn't make your game go faster, only the Game's disk-access, nothing more and nothing less. That's the point BTW! If you don't fathom what is being offered here, don't get it, it's that simple! I have been using RAM DISKs since the good old DOS days on my trusty old 486 with 8MB (that's right folks: Mega-Bytes), creating a 5MB RAM Disk to run the shareware version of DOOM 1 into it and it ran like a shower of s.h.i.t ! Damn, also gave away my age then too ... For anyone who seriously wants to learn the fathoming thing, here's a few tips to be aware of: 1: first make sure the game (or application) runs normally in steam without dimmdrive active;  then, and ONLY then, use it on dimmdrive; if you have problem beforehand, don't expect it to magically work in dimmdrive; 2: if your system crashes, run memtest on your ram to make sure it actually works without faults (memtest is a free download btw) 3: make sure your system is not running hot (cool is good) 4: have a decent powersupply (clean power is good)  ... and lastly, don't forget: it's also a disk-drive, which shows up in explorer ... that means you can put 'other' stuff on it too (imagination required for this one ...)  after having used it for a little while already, I have decided to give it 10 out of 10! ... because it works just like all the other RAM drives I have used in the past with one exception: I don't need to reboot my system to blow away the RAM disk before re-creating it with a different size ... ... and for crying out load, it integrates with steam games as well, what the hell MORE do you want ... ?  remember, it's a DISK DRIVE, Jim! ...

In all reality this program is amazing. I'm stubborn. I have 2 SSD's in RAID 0 that i play my games off of and even their speed drives me nuts sometimes. Dimm Drive has made my impatience go away.  I setup Dimm Drive to run all my modelling and animation programs. Photoshop, Black Ink, Pixeluvo. As well as Leadwerks Game Engine, Game Maker, Unity, 3ds Max. you get the idea.  Initially I had a problem where I couldn't get games to work with this program so i did what anyone would do.  Post your question/problem to the Community Discussion Board. Got a reply from Tim within a few hours and he was with me every step of the way.  My solution was simply restart my computer again and everything fixed itself. Mind you i had restarted my computer after I had installed Dimm Drive, but that didn't work. I did everything I knew and nothing worked, but finally a simple restart did the trick.  -------------- The actual program review --------------  Dimm Drive does what it is intended for, making your workflow be speedy fast.  It does this by giving you an easy to use menu with very intuitive options for what you want loaded onto your Dimm Drive.  That is what this program does, but it doesn't stop there!  What separates this program from the free RAM disk programs that you may find on the net, Dimm Drive has seamless syncronization with Steam. Meaning just like when you exit a game on steam it uploads your save game information and settings back to steam so does Dimm Drive. Automatically. You don't need to do anything.  As i stated above, Dimm Drive is fast. Sometimes too fast depending on the speed of your RAM and CPU.  DO NOT LET THAT DISCOURAGE YOU. You need Dimm Drive in your life. It makes your computer responsive just like you always wanted it to be.  Dimm Drive is a no-brainer, and with a Dev Team behind it that keeps up with their product you can be sure to have your problems solved lickety split.  I was super impressed with their response time and professionalism as well as calmness with how they reply to questions.  P.S. Tim, accept my friend request. I'd like to talk some time and keep in touch. This program is what the Master Race needed a long time ago.",

It sounded farfetched and if I saw it advertised anywhere else I probably would have scrolled right past not giving it much thought. So I started doing my homework. I watched a ton of YouTube vids, I researched other Ramdisk programs, checked out a lot of benchmarks, and last of all I went to Tim's forums @  dimmdrive.com . Everything checked out, and I especially liked how active and enthusiastic Tim is with his community! I bought it on his website a few days before it dropped on Steam because I couldn't wait! I wrote him a quick PM on the forums requesting a swapover to Steam and 10 minutes later he had key for me... AWESOME!  Now... I have an aging rig, its a dual core 2.7ghz, 8gigs of ram and a nVidia 650 1ghz. Needless to say my equipment isn't the best, but it has served its purpose and then some. I have been getting pretty choppy gameplay with newer games for awhile now. After installing DimmDrive and loading up a super choppy game (State of Decay), I was blown away! It didn't give me more FPS or better graphics, it just smoothed everything out and made it consistent. I've tried a bunch of games in my library and they all work amazing. Granted, for some I had to go through and determine which files were being used the most and add them in manually because I only have 8 gigs of ram, but you do it once and its done.  For me, a gamer on a budget I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and I'm blown away with the customer care that I've gotten already and from what I've read on the dimmdrive forums.

Dimmdrive is the ONLY RAM drive that is offered on Steam and is the only one ever made that automatically syncs with Steam.  Unlike the non-Steam version of Dimmdrive, this version is usable offline, which is a pretty big deal to people with laptops with a good amount of RAM and/or people who have bad internet connections.  All currently downloaded Steam games automatically appear in Dimmdrive without any need for user input, and non-Steam programs (like EA games, Ubisoft games, LoL, WoW, etc.) are super easy to put into Dimmdrive.  Dimmdrive is the only RAM disk that I have ever seen that allows for you to select specific files from a game, letting you play larger games (say 20GB) on computers with less RAM (say 16GB). This is a pretty big deal, especially considering that a lot of newer games have been ridiculously large.  While SSDs are really fast, they come nowhere close to the speed of even the crappiest quality RAM. To match the speeds offered by Dimmdrive with SSDs you would need to spend thousands of dollars and put dozens of SSDs in RAID together.  I recommend Dimmdrive to anybody with at least 8GB of RAM and I recommend it as a MUST HAVE program for anybody with 16GB or more.  I will not play any game on my PC with slower than instantaneous load times without using Dimmdrive.",

I had been planning on building a new system with lots of extra RAM and this was the perfect excuse to have that extra RAM so I bought it way back then.   Now I see it's on steam which is excellent. I've used the program off and on for more than a year and I'm very impressed with the progress Tim has made. The interface is more polished and I think everything in general seems to work a bit more smoothly.   Games may appear to take longer to launch, but that's because it's putting everything into RAM for use later. One delay and then lightning fast access times.   Now I just need to buy another 16GB of RAM  EDIT: So having 16GB of RAM only realistically leaves me with 8 or 9 GB to use as a RAMdisk, but thankfully you don't need to store the entire thing in RAM. You store the most commonly used files in the RAMdisk and leave the rest on the hard drive and you're fine.   I've been using it with Elite Dangerous and also combining it with the USB 3.0 thing and it really doesn't take much extra time at all to get started... I see it start loading the most used files into memory for about 20-30 seconds and then after that I'm done.   I start up the game and anything that would normally take time to load is down to nothing. I still have to wait if the game decides to lag on me (like going into supercruise) but that's a network issue, not a drive issue.   They've also fixed the problem of this showing up as the game you're playing 24/7. Now you start it up, it runs for a minute or so and then steam stops showing it as active so you can play something else.  The Instructional videos Tim has put up are a big help if you're not sure how to get a certain game working right.",

And this software really needs some kind of comparsion table for launch times and overal work speed for Steam games. Anyway, looks promising.",
