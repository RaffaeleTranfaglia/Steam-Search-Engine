In addition, you have three different types of hidden stuff to find , which makes the game even better !  You play as a Fairy-tale investigator - what could be more interesting and fun ? :) And this time you have to  investigate the story of The Little Mermaid .  Some said the game is pricy, but I do not agree - it is worth every penny.   And now there are cards added ! The Mermaid background is Beautiful !   So , the only thing missing here, is Steam achievements - ! But !  There are lots of achievements in-game, and really fun ones to try and get !  These achievements added to Steam would have made this game Perfect !  Highly Recommended !",
