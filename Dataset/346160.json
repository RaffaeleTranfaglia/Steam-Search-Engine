As this was kickstarter funded you will notice that the character portraits are of people who supported the game, nice touch. The important thing is gameplay, and this game has a lot of depth. A main quest supported by lots of side quests, crafting,farming,mining,cooking there is a lot going on. The battles are the same as 3 Stars of Destiny typical RPG maker format, different tactics for different enemies are needed so a bit of thought has to be taken. I have played about 2 hours and so far there is a always something to keep me coming back. So for a cheap game give it a whirl.",

Pros: For its price this game can easily be worth more for what you can do. Not even the $25's, 30's, 45's &amp; 50's dollar price games can be this good sometimes at there prices - What are you waiting on, get the damn game now!!!  Cons: Only thing I see wrong with the game is that your reading my review and not playing this freaking good game - get off your high horse and pay up!! Chop Chop!!",
