            "review_text": "Well... it's a decent game. It has some flaws but it's not bad. Three main characters: Velvet, Alanna, Yekatherine.   Velvet is very interesting and unique. her character type isn't totally new but it's not common. Alannah is ridiculously stereotypical and definitely nothing new. BUT! you are playing a dating sim so you SHOULD expect her and you probably even like her. She's the 'best' candidate but least interesting. Yeka, as most will say, it's probably the best character. When I first heard people saying this, I was doubtful but now that I did her ROUTE... yea, she is. I'm glad I went back a third time to do her route.  So: the charactes are alright. Nothing amazingly new but they hold up the story well enough. The overall story is... non-existance but that's not a big deal as that's not the point. It's character driven and it succeeds in that.  THERE IS NO SKIP. So you are in FACT forced to play through the game 3 times without any skip (there is exactly ONE scene you skip, thank god, and it's when they are telling stories.). And the game's script is 90% the same in all routes. Really. So I watched a movie and just click the spacebar. The routes themselves are fine (look at my comments on the characters) but some of the text is... holy ♥♥♥♥. They have some long scenes of pointless writing. You'll skip it even on your first readthrough as it's totally unnecessary stuff. I mentioned it before: They have a scene where they tell each other stories. What the ♥♥♥♥. That's not a problem usually, sometimes these breaks are good, but: 1. I don't care about these stories 2. you can't skip and they are long 3. They aren't written interestingly. Honestly, I think dialogue barely makes up 25% of the game. That's a flaw I think. Dialogue should be more prevalant in character driven thing or a dating sim. Hell, they keep talking about theories and ideas.   As for the written stuff: some stuff are untranslated (VERY VERY MINOR stuff like 'Chapter end') and some things are not spelled right. Totally acceptable and nothing serious. Some grammar is weird and some phrases are bizarre. But it's all well done. You can understand everything. So honeslty, this paragraph isn't even a con.  Music is fine, art is pretty good, especially the CGs. I guess I liked it but it's not in my top favorites. It was average.",
