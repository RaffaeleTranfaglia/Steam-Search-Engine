            "review_text": "(Disclaimer: I was the QA lead for Sekai Project's localization of Machina of the Planet Tree -Planet Ruler- so feel free to take this with the entire salt shaker.)  Planet Ruler is an amazingly fun and adorable indie JRPG. I'm a fan of JRPGs in general, so I was expecting to enjoy working on this when I got the opportunity, but between the battle system and the catg-- I mean, the way I ended up really liking all of the characters, it exceeded my expectations.  To get the one big downside out of the way first, it's not all that long - I'd ballpark it as being around 7-10 hours for a playthrough that doesn't get stuck on any of the bosses, but it's hard for me to say because I had access to the game files so I knew a lot of the game's inner workings and also had to spend time checking every little thing, both of which distorted my playtime significantly. It's also fairly linear, with no real sidequests other than finding the items needed to upgrade your party's weapons.  But past that, it has a fairly unique battle system where you string attacks together using a 'Cost' system - basically action points - and deal additional damage on later hits, based on both the number of attacks used, and the number of hits those attacks each dealt. Figuring out what enemies are weak to and then setting up a string of attacks that both builds up the combo meter and strings as many TP-costing 'Over-Arts' as you can into the mix without using more TP than you want can be a challenge, but one the game rewards by letting you blow through enemies. Battles are pretty action-packed, especially because the game doesn't really encourage holding back - during boss fights especially, it ends up feeling like every turn is an extreme all-out attack.  I also ended up really clicking with more or less all of the characters. Cram is adoracute. *nods* Also, especially if you can understand a bit of Japanese, all three of the playable characters (plus Cronos) have amazingly adorable and hilarious voice acting in combat. Even if you can't, though, the banter between the party outside of combat is really, really good and funny.  So yeah. Even if I wasn't paid to work on this game, I'd have to recommend it to JRPG fans. For people who aren't into JRPGs very much but still enjoy anime-styled games, I'd still recommend trying it, especially if their objections are more that JRPGs are long and boring, or don't involve much strategy, than that they're too complicated. (If it's that they're too complex... yeah, Planet Ruler's combat system isn't super tough, but it's significantly more in-depth than 'hit the bad guy, heal when you get hurt.')",

The dialogue is well done, and when I went into battle and heard Cram and Cronos yelling in japanese I thought that was awesome for an rpg maker game.  10/10 would listen to angry Japanese again.",
