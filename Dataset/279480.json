            "review_text": "I've always loved this board game! It's sort of an abstract sumo wrestler strategy thing where you're trying to lure opponents to the edge and use their momentum against them. The weight of the pieces as they clack along the track and against each other was just perfect.  This adaptation does a great job of capturing the physical feeling and the controls are just right. It's also nice that you can try out moves and undo them without the opponent seeing, rather than having to imagine the outcome and poker-face.  Matchmaking finds me an opponent within about 30 seconds and seems to do some amount of matching based on skill. Since lag and language isn't an issue it can easily pull from the worldwide pool. There's no chat features... I wish there was at least a selection of emoticons so I could congratulate good plays. After each match you can watch the full replay at fast speed. In about 10 games I've never seen anyone rage quit when I'm clearly at an advantage.  I haven't tried the single player vs AI or non-traditional layouts. But it has a nice interactive tutorial and several simple practice levels of increasing difficulty to teach the game.  My only complaints are the missing chat feature, a way to see the total online pool of players searching, and the stupid chime sound when you knock out a piece. Otherwise I'm really happy with this version.",

The only bad thing is that you have to click on the bottom right part of the screen to end your turn, you can not set a hotkey or anything. Also it takes like 4 hours for all the cards to drop, which is bad with broken achievements. I gave up playing to idle after 2 hours",

Even then the display settings cannot be changed without the game crashing to desktop and not saving the settings.  Don't waste your time with a game that the developers clearly don't care about their customers, only the literal pennies it brought in.",

It looks like an interesting abstract game, but I guess I'll never find out for sure unless it gets fixed. Disappointed with quality control all around here.",
