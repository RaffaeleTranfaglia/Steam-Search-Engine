            "review_text": "Questerium: Sinister Trinity HD is a well-made hidden object game that I'd put up near my top recommendations in this genre. While the formula is familiar -- a mystery unfolds and is solved through a combination of cut scenes, hidden object hunts, solving mini-game puzzles, and finding necessary objects to progress through the story -- the execution is good and the game is fun.  The use of live actors in the animated setting was an interesting choice that certainly sets this game apart. It's a little jarring at first, but it blends a little better once you get used to it. The acting's pretty over-the-top campy, and it made me laugh more often than not, like a cheesy B-movie performance. I'm not sure if that's quite the result that was intended, but it amused me and it worked with the game.  I really like the addition of findable money in the scenes, and that you can use the money to upgrade a garden patio (though I kind of question the desire to buy plants while encountering the plants throughout the story!) I also like the collectible plants that you pick up in different locations, and the way the achievements unlock objects in a virtual trophy room.  The story is decent, and though it is somewhat predictable, the journey is still fun. The artwork is good, and very colorful. The hidden object scenes are nice, and most involve multiple objects where you have to piece things together or uncover them first, making them a bit more challenging than a simple point-and-click thing. Where Questerium shines, though, is in its mini-games. Some of the puzzles are really clever, and I had a lot of fun working them out.",

            "review_text": "Well this certainly was an interesting game! There are a lot of things happening in this game that might give you the impression it's a bad game, but it's not. Some cliche elements are present and it has other draw backs but over all it's worthy of playing.  First the elephant in the room, the graphics. The game uses motion capture for the characters and it looks very weird and out of place. The actors are running around the game and they don't fit. However, this also adds a campy charm to the game. It made me laugh, especially with the bad acting. I don't know if this was intentional or not but it amused me none the less. The game is fully voiced but I don't think it's by the mocap actors, unless they dubbed over things later because the lip flaps don't match the audio. This also leads to what is being said not always matching the text on the screen.  The gameplay is fun and the game is full of achievements to collect which adds a nice level of challenge and accomplishment. The hidden item scenes are fun and look great, the puzzles can make you scratch her head but none are impossible. I guess my only gripe would be the garden aspect, it has nothing to do with the story or really anything in the game. Just adds something to find I guess, that's about it. All of the other achievements are found through story progression or at least relate to the game's theme.  Kooky and campy with a story out of a 50's horror movie, this game won't leave you bored. If you enjoy this genre of game I recommend adding Questerium to your library.   Lunar Productions  [lunarproductions.tumblr.com] ",

            "review_text": "Quite a solid HOG game that I enjoyed playing through. The graphics and music are fine for this type of game, though as is common for a HOG, the acting is kind of terrible, but its that kind of terrible thats amusing more than anything. Besides who playes a HOG for academy award winning acting? If you like HOG games there are certainly worse out there than this one and you will have a good time with it. If I had one gripe its that some of the puzzle minigames are not properly explained. One towards the end especially is baffling in its lack of coherent explanation. Fortunately you can skip it so its not a huge loss.   7 out of 10",
