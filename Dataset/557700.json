            "review_text": "This one is hard for me to call. On one hand I love CYOA games and CoG and this is obviously one of those. But on the other hand I've never been quiet as frustrated with one of these games either. My first play through was very frustrating. It seemed I failed every thing I attempted, without quiet managing to kill myself while doing so. After Hobbling to the end, and truely not happy with the ending I got, I of course immediately started another play through, checking my stats with every choice / action I made. This helped some in figuring out what happened after the fact with my choices, allowing me to figure out what the best choice to take in a given situation was based on the stats I was sometimes un wittingly gaining / loosing but seriously removed any enjoyment from the game play. And sometimes things still didnt make sense. Sometimes a choice would increase a stat, other times it would check a stat. All in All I think this game needs some serious feed back between players and maker to iron out wrinkles in the game mechanics so that they make more sense and allow a player to have a better idea of what their choices will earn them, or require of them to be succesful. That said, the story itself is very interesting. I really enjoyed the world setting and most of the characters. I really wish I could have explored some things / places more! Especially the world of Deep Tech. I definetly feel there is room in this world for more adventures, exploring, and just mingling. So I'm going to give this one a thumbs up in hopes of encouraging the author to revisit the game mechanics some, and maybe consider a DLC or another game in the same world setting that will let me further explore this fascinating place.",
