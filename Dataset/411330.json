            "review_text": "Nice to see a great 'Nam-themed shooter here on Steam!  Men of Valor was released in the early 2000s like the famous 'Vietcong'. It's a classic FPS - You are a US-Marine, who faces the cruelties of the early Vietnam War in 1965. The controls are easy ( I miss the Iron sights though), the voice acting is cool, and the cutscenes are peppered with original shoots from the war.  As a big surprise for an old game (which is released on Steam after a decade), this one runs stable on modern PCs.  A definite recommendation for shooterfans! ",

            "review_text": "It becomes clear to me why this game drowned when it first came out in 2004. I wanted to love it, but here is why I couldn´t:  I love vietnam shooters and I would say this here is the second best out there in terms of the FPS genre. But it has some incredible major flaws in its design and sadly proofs why the vietnam era of games never caught on to be a prime of the FPS genre.  I play on Win XP so I can´t give any insight of what issues this game has on modern systems.   Let´s start.   Length, Story and Presentation:   It´s pretty short to begin with if you play it quickly and don´t die too often. You have 13 missions which I each finished in roughly 30 mins. If you have a good aim and know your FPS games, you run through this pretty quickly, it has a decent ending though. Graphicswise the game was ok in 2004, it had all you wished for a nice jungle environment but I gotta say the animations in the cutscenes are bugged and break immersion, as well as the sound design. While the animations are too fast or too abrupt and buggy, the sounds often are of different quality, sometimes high quality sounds and then low quality appear next to each other in the effects or voice department, such as marines shouting or explosions. Gun sounds are beefy and done nicely, obviously with most of the sound budget going in there, the rest doesn´t stand out and often even falls too short in terms of quality and atmosphere. Between missions you get characterization in form of letters written from your dad to you and you to your parents with reports of thoughts and what´s going on. Typical war letters which explain situations at home and with your characters streams of thoughts. You play the generic black marine called Dean Shepard. While I liked those parts, a real story as in cutscenes or plot doesn´t exist. You simply play missions as experiences of an marine. I wasn´t immersed enough to care in terms of storywriting. The graphics are average at best too with some nice gun models and character models, decent textures and fog, water, etc. Not as shiny as Far Cry, not as ugly as vietcong but also not even as artistically atmospheric as Vietcong nor as beautiful and advanced as Far Cry. It gets the job done. Vegetation is thick and animated and it feels like jungle even though the corridors are quite obvious. Vietcong gave you a more open feel, sometimes literally being semi open world compared to Men of Valor. MoV is straight up corridors with objectives. Cutscenes in between chapters are historical flicks presenting information about the vietnam war and your next area of operation. From Khe Sanh to the Tet Offensive. Loading screens are presented with president´s quotes etc.     Gameplay, Gunplay, AI, etc.:   Your squadmates can shoot and move. That´s about it. They have names you forget as the presentation and story can´t keep you thrilled enough to give a s h i t nor should you. The enemy AI is straight up dumb as rocks, running past you or keeping an blind eye to their path finding or they straight up aimbot you depending if its NVA or VC or farmers. It happens only occasionally but can get annyoing in the worst scenarios, same goes for your squadmates. I´ve seen that hodges guy run past enemy lines too often to care anymore. You can´t give em commands like in vietcong, taking control out of your hands as well. The guns feel different and are fun to shoot with decent animations and models, even sounds are nice when not as authentic as ... yes i say it again.. Vietcong. Objectives are repetitive and barely change from what you see in the first fiew missions. There are a few decent missions where objectives feel fresh and so does level design, but that is done in the first third of the game and barely ever comes back.   At the second half of the game most spawnpoints in the world are set to solely make you ragequit. You have to carefully advance otherwise you trigger enemy spawns and enemies just spawn all around you and you are cucked without the support of your squadmates. The tasks and objectives become repetitive very quickly. Some buildings have collision detection issues, so do some rocks and enemies themselves. Thankfully barely any trees have. Meaning even when cowering like a m o t h e r f u c k e r behind your rock and you can see the enemy, you can´t hit him as you shoot the rock instead. But you don´t notice it because lack of decals such as bulletholes make it hard to get feedback. The enemies give feedback when hit, such with animations and blood unless they run in which they barely react at all to your shots.  Another issue is movement speed. You either snail walk or you jog, which is your standard fastest speed and it´s infuriating in dire situations! Make sure you play by the games rules as you can´t jump either and looting enemies takes 2 secs if you can even reach them without running into the enemy directly. You can run out of ammo as well which means reloading the last checkpoint. You can´t quicksave! So you have to rely on these quite widely spread checkpoints. Some guns have different values as others, the most effective ones are semi auto high caliber rifles such as the SKS and M14, while the M16, CAR 15, Type 56, AK47, RPD, M60, Scoped Mosin and M21, Thompson M1, PPSh 41, but the snipers are rarely used and I wished for more variety. Most guns are less accurate and powerful and require you to shoot from crouching or lying, which improves accuracy a lot but the sad thing about that is that due to the jungle environment, crouching and lying basically renders you an idiot, as you can´t spot any enemy anymore. So using the semi auto modes on those guns is key to survival. A deep cut in fun by stupid game design. Another stupid game design was the aiming and leaning feature. If you aim with your gun you can´t strafe, instead you lean left or right. There are no iron sights, just a zoom with your crosshair. If you manage to adopt to that system, congrats, otherwise you will curse the game designers. You have an option for enabling loose aimpoint, aka rail shooter fixed camera with moveable gun and crosshair, but that´s just for personal preference anyway.  You can´t choose anything besides medium difficulty unless you played the game once, or at least I think that was a bug in my game... I really can´t figure it out. In terms of difficulty balancing the game is f u c k e d either. Headshots gets them down pretty easily while everything else is basically the same damage multi. 3 shots in the toes is the same as 3 in the back with most machine guns. Only semi auto only guns with higher caliber are different. They are often 1 hit headshot or 2 hit body shot depending on enemy type. Damage inflicted on you however is broken. You either take small chunks of health when hit or half of it directly which leaves you swearing again and most enemies have the same 7.62 ammo or guns. For health you collect canteens from looting enemies and rarely you find medic kits laying around. If you are hit you need to hold the bandage button so you don´t bleed out too quickly. You can basically restore most of the lost health from the gunshot by doing that, as it fills up the medicus that serves as a health indicator on the left down corner of your screen.    Conclusion:   Repetitive, mediocre, flawed designed unimpressive vietnam game by the leftovers of 2015 who made the fantastic but also flawed yet still superior Medal of Honor Allied Assault. The rest of 2015 left to establish Infinity Ward of which you guys know Call of Duty from. The good guys left, the rest stayed. And the rest made this game. Men of Valor. It´s more of a Original Xbox diamond than a PC diamond. A decent shooter with a nice promise but mediocre execution. I can not recommend it to anyone who isn´t an FPS veteran, or someone who loves vietnam era games or does care for the things said above.",

            "review_text": "Men of Valor is a mediocre experience verging on frustrating. The base gameplay is ok but it really isn’t anything that special. However due to poor enemy placement and a lack of any sort of quick save feature the game can be very frustrating. Enemies are often very hard to see, and even sometimes spawn in behind you. There is some fun to be had with the game when you aren’t being constantly pinned down by unknown assailants but like I said before the just OK gameplay gets tiresome after awhile. Making it, at least in my eyes not worth the heartache. (Sidenote:This game looks very poor even by 2004 standards game like Half-Life 2 and Farcry came out the same year)",
