Here's my experience:    Pros   • Gameplay is familiar to the SR4 (which was pretty good). • Good flying mechanics. • Several different endings.    Cons   • Very short. • There is no main quest, just a lot of sidequests. • Can't customize your character. • Can't customize your cars (but who need cars here?) • All neutral npc have same model.  Overall, I can't say that game is bad, it's easy playing and fun as previous titles, but the disappointing part is that it ends just in the time when you start enjoying it. And that's kinda sad. ",

Regardless, while I did have fun playing it, the story was much too short for me to give it any truly positive rating.  Having bought it at the -75% price ($3.75), it's definitely worth it. It's not worth full price at all, and those looking into it should wait for a big sale to pick it up. Loved the musical numbers, found them hilarious. Wish we could have seen more of Satan's daughter, perhaps in a future SR game? She's great.",

            "review_text": "Saint's Row: Gat Out of Hell is the newest installment of the Saint's Row Franchise. It is a standalone expansion to Saint's Row IV, and as such shares a lot of similarities with it, mainly the gameplay and superpowers.  Let's get the obvious question out of the way: you do not need to have Saint's Row IV installed to play, although Gat Out of Hell will automatically detect a Saint's Row IV savefile on your system and import your custom Boss into the game for use in cutscenes.  The story begins right where Saint's Row IV leaves off. Having conquered Simulation 31 and taken down the Zin Empire, the Saints are now living aboard their 'borrowed' spaceship which now houses the entirety of whats left of the human race. We are introduced to Kinzie's birthday party, where Matt is getting the Saints to try out a Quija Board. Spoilers aside, this does not go well and a portal straight to Hell opens up and drags the Boss in. Johnny Gat and Kinzie decide to go in after him.  Without spoiling too much more, I will say that this game is still as fun to play as previous Saint's Row titles. You can expect your fair share of awesome weapons, including many themed after the 7 Deadly Sins. My favorite of these are the Diamond Gun that literally shoots diamonds (Greed) and the recliner mounted with a chaingun and rocket launchers (Sloth).  There is a brand-new map with plenty of the usual diversions and activites to participate in aside from the main story. Many of the activites from Saint's Row IV return, but with their own Hellish flair. For example: Trailblazing is now Hellblazing, requiring you to fly through orbs and checkpoints to complete it. Rather than a traditional progression of missions, Gat out of Hell has players completing diversions and causing general chaos in an effort to raise the level of a meter called Satan’s Wrath. Once certain milestones are met on the meter, a cutscene is triggered. The game turns into a musical at times during these scenes, which may be quite enjoyable for some as they are played out in fully-voiced cutscenes with decent dance and lyrics.  Superpowers return from IV, and they’re upgraded by collecting Soul Clusters that are scattered around hell. Most are returning powers (blast, stomp, aura) with some new elemental powers, but Summon is exclusive to Gat out of Hell. Depending on which variant you use, it allows you to recruit imps to your side, make towers explode out of the ground, or produce a giant demonic ally.  All of this is fine and dandy, as the game is such a blast to play, but fans of the franchise may be disappointing in the omission of certain features that have long been established in the series. For one, since you play as either Johnny Gat or Kinzie Kinsington, you are pretty much stuck with the outfit they have by default. There are no clothing stores in hell. Also omitted was the ability to whip out a cell phone and have an ally deliver a vehicle to you. This isn't too big of an issue, as you can at anytime sprout wings and fly wherever you need to go. Flying controls are pretty smooth, with upgrades allowing more refined control while in-flight. And finally, there are no 'home bases' to upgrade or radio stations while driving, not even an option to import music from your PC to use in-game.  Gat Out of Hell isn't a long game, and as a standalone expansion I didn't expect it to be. After about 2 hours of play my save completion percentage read a modest 45%. Gat Out of Hell delivers what you'd expect from the Saint's Row franchise, just in a smaller package. Overall, it is worth shelling out the asking price of $19.99, especially if you are a long-time fan.         Saints Row:Gat Out of Hell - Gameplay Demo&nbsp;",

One of the best thing is the wings and the flying (/Challenges). the flying looks cool and makes DAMN MUCH fun, flying over see's of fire through hell like a god, i would pay the full price just for THIS option alone.   it must be your own view if this game destroys saints row or make it better, i just can say i ENJOY it and its funny.",

You get to play Johnny Gat and Kinzie when the Boss gets abducted by Satan so that he can marry his daughter Jezebel to the Saints Leader.  That is all the premise of the plot you need to know. If you loved SR4, you will enjoy this expansion to a new other level. If you haven't played any of the Saints Row game, I would recommend that you get the Game of the century edition of SR4 when it is on sale as it has more missions and gameplay hours and then, get this 1 when it is on sale. At full price, it is more for the fans of the series I think.  Easily the most fun I had playing a game in the last few months.",

You will probably fall into one of two camps:  'Camp: Gat out of Hell is the same as Saints Row IV, therefore I dislike it'  or  'Camp: Gat out of Hell is very similar to Saints Row IV, I liked Saints Row IV, therefore I like this game' .    -Detailed breakdown review-   If you were not a fan of the Saints Row Series, you very well might utter the phrase 'Burn in Hell Saints!' ...that or if you were eavesdropping on Roman Emperor Nero.  (what's that? no religion jokes, oops)  Well this game is the almost literal manifestation of that phrase. The saints started out as a simple street gang, became public figures, became    politicians, and the boss became the president of the United States. Then Earth was destroyed and they are now in space!   you very well might be asking 'well, where else can they go? What else can they do?' Enter the Super Natural.

I haven't finished this game yet, and usually I write a review when I do, but so far, this game is pretty lack luster.  It's Saints in Hell, and I have not seen 'Yet at least' any 'Highway to Hell' references, or the song playing. No fat duo on a guiatr playing Tenacius D against edemons characters, no political figure or jokes on that line following the lyrics foto Fire Water Burn from Bloodhound Gang.  For crying out loud, it's a Saints Row game in Hell with the perfect excuse to have the most beautiful Succubus as a standard foe, and the first time you see a Demon Girl is about as ugly as the 'Civs' in this gameuy or any of the male standard chumps.  Also, I bought a pre order that gives you 'Shakespeare's Skull' which I thought would be a great opportunity to create a weapon character, a skull that could talk and almost be a companion. Instead you get a laser flame throwing thing that barely deals any damage.",

The story is nice: your boss (which, if you own a previous game of the saga, will be your previous character) is sucked into Hell because he caused so much destruction and chaos that Satan wants you to marry his daughter. Gat and Kenzy jumps into hell to save you.  Many minigames comes from the previous title and this is good as they were really enjoyable, many more are new and nice. In this game Flight is the most important power as you will need it to gather the Soul Cluster to improve powers and to move back and forth in the city. Flight is really enjoyable and as the fourth chapter you can still use cars and vehicles but you'll mostly flight or sprint although here flight is really nice and you will not miss using vehicles (as the customization and power up of those is missing, which makes sense.

The ending it took me a while as I had to buy up HP upgrades and so on, but it did not feel so impressive, but I do love how the option to do the ending is still there because you have a choice of multiple endings, all very interesting and quite funny, like finding a new earth to inhabit, that is already inhabited by violent psychotic creatures and would make a very interesting SR game if they took it from the several islands to a FULL world map. That would be incredible, as well as buiilding up human society and having each place protected.  I'd certainly recommend this game to all dans of SR.",

If you don't care about that or don't mind that, then the game is nothing but fun, with a musical number! :D  Did you like Saints Row the Third and Saints Row IV? Then you also want this. :)",

The most cool thing which was added that Johny and Kinzie fly in hell ( especially when you fully upgraded this ability). Unfortunately half of game consists of additional missions. From weapons are best 7 deadly sins. Advantages: game is not worse than previous parts; theme of hell; creative cutscenes Disadvantages: not many new ideas; just new skins; short story 7,4/10",

You can switch between the two of them at any time, but the story revolves around Gat. Basically the story starts right after Saints Row 4 with the President (your character) getting thrown into a wormhole to Hell. You come to find out Satan has kidnapped the President to marry his daughter. Gat and Kinzie volunteer to follow and rescue the President from Satan. Surprisingly, Hell looks very similar to Steelport. You end up meeting Blackbeard, Vlad the Impaler, the Twins from Saints Row 3-4, and William Shakespeare? William Shakespeare apparently is in hell which surprised me. Anyways, you play the game essentially like Saints Row 4. Collect orbs to redeem for power ups and earn money to upgrade guns and abilities. If you haven't played Saints Row 4 or 3, I'd recommend checking those out first. Especially 4, since this is pretty much a standalone DLC for Saints Row 4 anyways. If you've played 4, you'll probably enjoy this.",

Even though the story is short I will admit that I still enjoyed playing through as it did hold the Saints Row vibe behind everything going on even when you are not playing as the customizable entity that is 'The Boss'.  Pros:   A nice continuation to see the story of the Saints.   Travel around a map that isn't Steelport. Again.   Fight off the demons and save your boss from Hell.     Punch the Devil in his stupid face.       View different endings to wrap up the story of the Saints.     Cons:   Short Story, however enough that I believe worth the price.   You're not the boss, therefore no character creation or editing to make a stylish you.   Heavily focused on the side activities to progress the game.   No radio, unlike the main games of the Saints Row franchise this side story comes with no radio and no playlists. Only time I heard music that wasn't made for the game was in cars that the demons would drive and the music would turn off when I stole their ride.   All in all, I enjoyed the game. I had fun and the powers here feel better than the powers of Saints Row 4 even if some are the same but renamed. Worth the $20? I say yes but it's me on the fence. If you're a fan of the Saints Row games I definitely say it's worth picking up for the story,",

However, the story missions makes for very little content, and with the diversions I got to 100% completion in just under 18 hours. For the price tag I guess that's what you can expect, but I'm missing that little extra bit, the one that makes me commited to a game. IV had some amazing set pieces, the wacky 1950s sitcom missions, the alien assault on the white house, fleeing the alien ship listening to eurodance one hit wonder Haddaway. I find nothing of this in Gat out of hell, with one exception: the musical number. I'd rate this 3 out of 5 for the love of the series.",

I don't think it suffers for it, but there's a lot less to do - take that as you will.  The atmosphere of the game is designed well: the cityscape is sufficiently hellish and the vehicles are all modified slightly in appearance and name, and sometimes function too. It's great fun to hop in a Comet, press E to set it on fire, and then drive along a main road for as long as you can before you explode. Encountering a Rambulance is also great for a laugh too, when you see them swerving all over the road aiming for pedestrians to hit. Finally you can go on a monster truck rampage and crush cars all over the road. I only wish they had added more quirky vehicles challenges like these.",

Cons: Feels short, because it is took me about 8 hours to reach 89%, which if you know Saints Row games means that there are just some collectables I didn't get. No real interaction with the various NPC homies. You meet them, run some tasks to earn their loyalty, and then you never see them again.

            "review_text": "So, overall, this was 12 hours of hilarious fun. I honestly didn't think Volition would be able to top some of the insanity in SR4 but --- well. A musical number. I guess that sums up the crazy in this one.  Gat out of Hell isn't without faults, though. I had a few game crashes, predominantly during survival missions. I also think the flight/sprint mechanic desperately needs a toggle option because you spend twelve f'ing hours holding a button to maintain flight/spring (as you do in SR4, also a mistake) and that's just no fun. Most of the activities are just reskins of previous ones from earlier games, though the Salvation version was a definitely a twist from previous iterations. It would've been nice to have an activity that really keyed into the aspect of 'hey, we're in hell!' (though the Fraud activity was in the right spirit, since it involves saving three former characters from previous games). I really missed the radio option too, though the BGM of the game was really good. But imagine (well, if the licensing was worth it, anyway) turning on the classic rock station and hearing 'Highway to Hell' or 'The Number of the Beast' on the metal station or even the 'Devil's Trill' on the classical station (not to mention what sort of weird commercials of dj talk could be used). It's not a huge thing but the lack of the radio (and the in-jokes that could be made) seems a little like a missed opportunity. Finally, even though the game lampshades it, the abitrary nature of when the story missions progress was a bit problematic, as each step (at least until the last mission) would interrupt my progress in activities or diversions.   One thing that I wasn't expecting but really liked is the way Volition stuck to using 'they/them' as gender-neutral pronouns when refering to the Boss/President, so as not to break immersion (you know, like when you pick the female PC option and everyone basically refers to you as a dude? That happens in so many games? Yeah, that.). There was one instance I caught with a 'he' instead of a 'they' but I appreciated the effort.   I definitely recommend this game and DEFINITELY recommend keeping a save right before you go to confront Satan, so you can see all five different endings (the retconed canon one is probably my favorite).",

I believe the only thing fun in this expansion is playing with the new powers and the big one, flight. In this game you have angelic wings and can fly around. The flying mechanic and ability is the best thing they could have made, but it makes cars and super speed useless.   Sprinting can only get you so far and is probably the last thing you will do before taking to the sky at high speeds once you get it down. The terrain is super hard to navigate with just sprinting alone and overall flying will be the better choice in the end, not that I am complaining.  I loved it but it's only because I am a sucker for wings and flying capabilities.  The activities isn't what made Saints Row great though, the hilarious story missions did and characters, which this has little to none of that besides finding the other minor/returning characters in this new world and    saving them in the end when they get captured  .   Otherwise there's not much else to do besides mess around and collect stuff. That is the end goal. I have to say Gat is an awesome character and I loved when they brought him back, but this expansion lacked a lot and should not have been a stand-alone expansion at all.   At most this should have a been a dlc continuing on from the last Saints Row. It would have been perfect...  If you like wings/flying, the activities from Saints Row 4, new guns, new powers, and Gat or Kinzie. I'd say it would be worth buying at full price if that is what you are into.  If not, I'd say wait for the price to drop to like $5 or less because it is not worth the $20.",

Mechanically this is a clone of SR4. Except for flight, all the powers, majority of weapons are the same exact ones you had in SR4 but instead of the source being hacking a virtual world, it is from Lucifers Halo. The names are different but functionally the same for most of them. The anti-power grenades from the previous game are back, but unexplained how it affects the supposedly most powerful artifact in the universe. Chasing down the orbs is back but now they're Sin Orbs. Once your notoriety gets high enough a boss plops down with the same hellfire rain from the last game and basically the same fight mechanics.   Unfortunately with so much same, whats different? Mostly just the look of the map and that you can play as Gat or Kinzie. Also the introduction of flying is really cool.   But a bigger question is whats lost? For me the most important thing missing is the cultivation of the plot. Despite having some potentially really interesting characters in the game like Shakespeare &amp; Vlad the Impaler there is almost nothing done with them. In lieu of almost any cutscenes in the game a still frame storybook device was used. So every time you expect to some really interesting interaction it cuts to the storybook and everything is summarised for you. No pop music/culture infused action moments   Also gone any type of customization. No private garages or helopads, no customizing vehicles, changing clothes, etc ...   Whereas in previous games you could pick different homies and see their different interactions with one another, you can pick no one here so thats gone. SR4 was full of celebrity homies like Roddy Piper &amp; Keith David with fun interactions.   This is basically the most Soulless version of Saints Row out of the last 3 or more versions. Describing this as basically a collection of the mini games from previous versions is mostly correct. The battle with Satan is weak and arguably much easier than reaching max notoriety.   I recommend this game but not at full price.   Volition, High Voltage whoever is calling the shots, take some time off, take a year or two and make a next gen Saints Row. Another installment like this on an already 4+ year old game engine could sink the franchise",

        {
            "review_text": " EDIT:  As of late October 2015, I am  still  unable to 100% complete the game thanks to a glitch preventing me from completing one of the Torment Fraud exercises.  Let's get one thing out of the way right now: for every positive thing this game boasts, there's also something negative that detracts from the experience. Though you may like something as a hardcore Saints Row fan, you will be unable to deny that there's something that turns you off to it. If you don't want to read everything, I've been so kind as to add a little 'TL;DR' at the bottom so that people can scroll to the end or Ctrl+F their way to it. So... let's start with:   THE PROS   • First off, being able to explore an entirely new overworld in the form of New Hades is amazing and much more refreshing than Steelport from Saints Row 3 and 4. It gives the game an entirely new feeling, making it stand out much more on its own, and gives you so much more to explore and discover. • Another great thing is the powers; yes, you have some rehashed abilities from SR4 and that's to be expected, but they all have their own unique flair. I loved being able to summon a Titan against one of Satan's archdukes, or surrounding myself in a heavenly glow that made all the demons of Hell bow in reverence... and gave me a massive damage boost. • Free-form flight is something I would've absolutely loved in SR4, and just the ability to soar through the sky dodging missiles and going through narrow passages in this game is euphoric for lack of a better word. Being able to jump multiple times in the air helps you keep better control, and just being able to descend for extra momentum during flights to preserve your 'flap' meter gives an even better sense of speed than super-sprinting or driving in cars. • Moving right along, the weapon selection is both creative and phenomenal. Being able to get seven different weapons that correspond to the seven deadly sins is definitely a nice spin on the more traditional SR formula where you just pick a weapon or two that you really like ( e.g.: the TOGO-13 from SR3 or the Black Hole Gun from SR4 ) and upgrade it to its maximum potential. Each weapon brings something funny and new to the table without seeming like a blatant rehash. • Finally, the story is fun and inventive, and it throws a few curveballs your way that you really don't expect part of the way through. I was flabbergasted when Satan, Jezebel, and even Kinzie and Johnny busted out in a full-blown Disney-esque musical.  Unfortunately, all that glitters is not gold, as they say. And as I said above, every silver lining in the sky is only overshadowed by the little thundercloud waiting to rain on your parade. Here come...   THE CONS   • The overworld, for all its new luster and polish, is pretty scant once you get rid of all the collectibles. It is as you would expect Hell to be: it's barren and full of fire in most places, and being able to fly over the map at top speeds really shows you how small it is by comparison. Granted, I was as annoyed as anyone in Saints Row 3 and 4 by Steelport being three kilometers across or so end-to-end, but with your many power-ups and weapons, there was always a creative way to travel ( my personal favorite was using the Abduct-O-Matic to ascend to maximum height in SR4 and then glide across the map ); with this game, you're flying everywhere at top speeds almost immediately. • Speaking of powers, if you're quick about it, you can get all the powers and a fair number of the upgrades and elements for them in less than the first hour. In SR4, I don't recall getting the Buff power until the start of the game's third act. It added longevity to the game, making you  want  to keep playing to fully upgrade yourself. Having access to the most powerful abilities in the game practically by default, I might as well be playing SR4 still. • Flight in this game, for as fun as it is, can be  really  hard to grasp and sometimes very finicky. I can be flying along without a care in the world, hit something I didn't see immediately and either perform a wall-run for some reason ( even against lampposts and other physics-affected objects ) or careen into it and shoot upward, losing all momentum and control for a few seconds. Without the 'Flight - Nimble' power-up, you're going to find maneuvering very hard for the first hour or two of your adventure. • Some of the weapons in the game quickly lose their fun factor after a little while, and there's going to be a lot of shooting in this game... after all, it's a Saints Row game and you're playing as Johnny Gat, who can only be described properly as 'trigger-happy' and 'murderous'. While it may be gratifying to kill enemies with the Diamond Sting weapon and collect all the money drops with your Vacuum Stomp power, it starts to become  boring . Most times, I find myself going to a Sinterpol store and switching out for my less powerful weapons like the Energy Caster and the Damned Impaler just to challenge myself further. You're already in Hell; dying literally has no consequence in this game aside from a few thousand currency units from your pocket... oh, and if you're looking for customization beyond choosing between Johnny and Kinzie and deciding what seven weapons you want to carry around, go back to the previous installments—Gat Out Of Hell boasts a total of ten stores, and they're all weapon shops... or rather, weapon vending machines. If you're looking for character customization in any form, please go back to Saints Row 3 or 4. • Finally, and it pains me to say this... the story is just so damn short. I thought I had so much more left to do, but by the time I actually got to Satan, I was less than four hours into the game! For a $20 USD title, I was kind of expecting at least double that, especially when the last game incorporated all sorts of side activities in their loyalty missions. In this game, however, all you do is: get buddy-buddy with people like William Shakespeare and Vlad the Impaler, go on one loyalty mission for each of your five new friends, save them from ritual sacrifice by a few Dark Inciters ( which are ♥♥♥♥ easy for the most part except for Kiki and Viola's ), and then go shoot Satan in the face with RPG rounds... I beat the game in less than four hours, and I was taking a leisurely stroll through the entire game.  Personally, because I liked the last two games so much, I paid full price and pre-ordered the game in hopes for getting something more than I did. Does that mean I didn't enjoy it? ♥♥♥♥ no, it's phenomenal... but the problem is that I don't feel right calling this a 'game' when it feels like glorified DLC at best. The pre-order rewards were absolutely not worth it, either, as I rarely found myself using Yorick ( aka 'Shakespeare's Skull' ) to fight enemies when it was constantly overheating, and the Saints wing skin is a pretty lackluster change even by cosmetic standards. Enemies and their overall typings in the game suffer the same problems as they did in SR4, and beating the game is the worst part because there's little else to do after you're done and have collected all seven deadly weapons... the worst of which is tied between the 'Boom Chicka' and the 'Armchair-A-Geddon'.   FINAL WORDS (TL;DR):   Is this game as good as previous installments in terms of gameplay? Yes, as there are a few new spins on familiar side missions that will occupy your time for a few hours, and the story is captivating if leaning heavily on the 'short' side.  Is this game as good as previous installments in terms of content? Gat Out Of Hell is to Saints Row 4 what SR:TT was to SR2—all you're really getting is a graphical overhaul with no real changes to the core mechanics.  Should you buy this game? If you're a die-hard Saints Row fan, yes... but even then, I would recommend waiting until a substantial (≥25%) price drop.",

Graphics: 10-10 Reason: Think of a hellish metropolis island essentially a square shaped landmass surrounded by a lake of molten lava. I just wanted to point out that going to far out away from the main island was too creepy for me to continue so i pussed out and started back to the main island, being unitentionally creepy gave it bonus points in my perspective. I played with ultra settings on 1920x1080 and it looked very vibrant and busy with enough random fun stuff always happening to get you smiling.  Overall: 9.0/ 10 Reason: The game for what it is worth and the money i spent on it was 100% worth it, the only sad thing and really the single reason why it doesnt get a 9.5 or 10 is because of the lack of offline co-op as well as and sort of steam matchmaking at all. The offline co-op does not exist so they could force people to buy their own copies *smart but stingy as well*. The supposed online co-op doesn't exist because i have no friends that play this and the steam matchmaking is a legendary joke.  ",

I liked the story, I enjoyed the game itself, but as my favorite part is the Third I got the feeling like I'm playing the Fourth part once more. I loved the idea to choose the ending although at first I chose totally not the one I intended to. I recommend this game to people who follows the saints row story line as it delivers again something new. I recommend the game to people who enjoyed the fourth part as well,  but I don't recommend it to people who thought that the fourth part was just too much with superpowers and stuff like that as this time again the whole game is based on the same abilities which were implemented in fourth part.  My rating for this sequel would be 3/5. (4th part 4/5 as it was something new, 3rd part 5/5 as it is one of my favorite games of the time)  One more thing I would like to add is that this part is completely story driven and it has little to no customization at all, if you want that, don't buy this!",

After those game, I was on board with more hot SR gameplay! However, Gat out of Hell disappointed me greatly.  Basically, Gat out of Hell consists entirely of those side activities you did for people in SR3/4. While SR4 had side quests done for people to get bonuses but also had unique main quests, this game has you doing ONLY side quests. The only real 'unique' quests are when you rescue people who defy Satan, but these are short lived.  You do these in order to ♥♥♥♥ off Satan and get his attention, so you can draw him out to kick his ♥♥♥. The progress for this is shown on a meter on the TAB screen, and it fills as you do these quests as well as cause chaos around the town. Once you hit certain milestones, cutscenes play and things change slightly for the overworld. When the meter fills, you unlock the final mission, which is a boss fight against Satan. Beat it, you win the game.  What I just said is hardly a summary. Side activities are ALL you do for the large chunk of this short game. If you've played SR3/4, you will recognize them because they're basically the same save for some slight modifications (Blazin', where you race through arrow checkpoints, now involves flying instead of sprinting). The only three new side activities involve powering up an altar with one of your superpowers followed by a short hoard-mode sequence, one where you unlock teleport points by activiting statues then defeating a big brute enemy, and one Domination-style one where you must activate three zones to take over a building while preventing enemy minions from taking said zones back from you. These new activities still feel like retreads however, and lack much variety.  Switching gears to talk about some minor issues, there generally feels like a lack of care put into the game. The voice acting lacks any sort of enthusiasm or emotion, and the writing comes off as terse, even forced at times. When doing online coop, sometimes the activities would not activate for my coop buddy and required me to finish them (thankfully he still got the quest completed after I did it).   What made me very sad is that this game just isn't funny, either in its written gags or visual jokes. I can only think of one moment that I found pretty amusing, but the rest of the game only has a few visual jokes (such as billboard ads or business name branding) and, as I mentioned before, poor writing and VA execution results in a lack of charm I've come to expect from the Saints Row games.  The streets of Hell do not excite in the least. The starting industrial area feels drab and lacking in life, and only really matters since that is where you start when you reload your save. The most interesting area has to be the market/amusement park/red light district New Hades, but even then it feels empty with little to do or see.  Lastly, and perhaps the thing that made me the saddest, must be the complete lack of customization! Gone are the various clothing stores, the taunts/complements, or even interesting vehicles to drive (save for a monster truck police vehicle). The only store provided consists of a vending machine that lets you buy ammo, upgrade weapons, and pay to get the Hell-cops off your back. It feels so impersonal and, adding with what I said about the writing, sucks a lot of charm that this series has.  I really am disappointed. I feel like this game was made on a budget, which its default price reflects. However, I'd argue that the good kind of budget games are those that put a lot of polish, charm, and love into a small experience rather than a large, average but bland one. Unfortunately this game is the latter. If you've played SR3 and/or SR4, just avoid this game. If you haven't, go play both those games because they're fun, especially with a buddy to tag along!",

Gat Out of Hell really isn't a bad game, but it's not a good one either. In my opinion this game is the definition of mediocre. The new story is uninspired, the new setting is a cool idea, but also very small and underutilized, and the way I see it there really isn't much reason to own this game. This game just has so much less than SR4 (fewer weapons, fewer powers, zero customization) while introducing next to nothing outside of a new coat of paint on the main city and some new cutscenes. I don't hate Gat out of Hell, but I also don't like it.  I reccomend that anyone interested in playing this game just buy Saints Row 4 instead. Already own SR 4? Well then buy a bit of DLC and replay the game. Chances are you'll have more fun with that than with this.",

The same minigames are drawn out here, just too long for it to be enjoyable.  The ragdolling is seriously out of hand. I spent equal amount of times being thrown around than actually playing the game. Similarly, they thought that the addition of anti-air defences to a game where flying is the only way around would be a fun addition. It is not. When trying to get from A to B you have to choices: (a) Stop and fight each of the 30 something AA towers or be shot down constantly and you guessed ragdoll and be interrupted.  The story is entertaining, although the actual story portion is pretty short. There is an intro and a loyalty mission for each of the 5 allies, but it hardly gives a lot of personality them. The musical number is true Saints Row fun though.  Overall, this is a DLC that is let down by the fact that the developer tried to stretch it into a standalone game. While I enjoyed the story, by the end the character's repetitive grunts when ragdolling (all the time) or being on fire (all the time when not ragdolling) is matched by my own. It is also not a good sign that it runs out of story content before the arbitrary level cap for the final mission is reached (which the game seems to be smugly aware of) resulting in contextless side activity grinding.  Get it on sale if a huge Saints Row fan. Otherwise don't bother. And the developer thought you would want to play this 5 times to unlock all the endings. Sigh...",

            "review_text": "NEUTRAL RECOMMENDATION. I really wish there was rating b/t Recommend + Don't Recommend on Steam.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  REVIEW:  Saints Row: Gat out of Hell is the latest installment in the often hilarious, over-the-top, ridiculous, &amp; insane Saints Row series. This game feels and plays actually like a stand-alone expansion pack or DLC (depends on how you look at it) to Saints Row 4, for better and/or for worse. If you liked how SR4 was controlled mechanically, you'll feel right at home with that, for the most part: action + gunplay feel a lot similar to the previous game (SR4). Throw in a blender some old elements, some new elements, and some removed elements - it's hard to actually quantify this experience. This expeirence has more ups + downs than a roller coaster, for better and/or for worse.  I wish GooH had more than mostly just Activities (side-quests) + MMO type of stuff, more or less. And more or less, most of your time here in GooH, you will be doing side-quests. If you liked doing Activities in Saints Row 4, you'll probably feel right at home here. Since this feels mostly like a stand-alone SR4 expansions/DLC, some of the activities feel similar or have been reskinned + re-tweaked to suit the new location of Hell. Others like Hellblazing (in which you fly around at reach checkpoints, in a certain amount of time) - feel completely new here.   The only real problem is - well, most of this game consists of just Activities. One of the joys of previous SR games like SR2, 3, and 4 was that a lot of the main missions were absolutely unique and excellent - especially when compared to the Activities. Not here, as you mostly have just Activities. You build-up your Satan's Wrath meter by doing whatever you do in the game-world - from Activities, completing Challenges, doing Loyalty Quests, and whatever else you can think of. Once this meter has been built-up, then you can confront Satan for an epic conclusion.  So, why are you in Hell? The Boss (i.e. the player character from the previous SR games) gets kidnapped on Kinzie's birthday by Satan, after all goes wrong when messing around with a Ouija board. Satan decides to take the Boss and have his daughter marry him. The player can play as either Kinzie or Johnny Gat, in which these two are going to get The Boss back and stop Satan. Every now and then, once you've done certain quests and/or you've raised your meter to a certain point, you will be greeted with something hilarious &amp; funny - in typical Saints Row fashion, of course. While many of these are well-written &amp; very funny. the game certainly could've used more of these cut-scenes + hilarious moments.  While it's pretty cool to play as either Johnny Gat or Kinzie (you can switch b/t the two at a certain location in the game), there's another issue here with GooH. Unfortunately, by being stuck w/ Gat and Kinzie - the player now does not have much customization on their looks, outfits, or anything of that sort...which is unlike most Saints Row experiences. SR experiences are usually overloaded with kind of customization - but, not here in SR: GooH.  Another drawback of the game not being a typical DLC and standing-alone on its own is that this game is not loaded with the music found in SR4. It's not like much music was created just for this game, either. You can't access music in a car or even at any time, which is what SR4 had going on - since there really isn't much for music here. Since this game seems to be lacking any of the licensed music from SR4, something feels completely lacking here in this department. This game certainly could've benefitted from having a MP3 Player Station like many of the GTA games on the PC feature.  One of the best new features here is, once you earn it: how to fly. If running up walls, jumping around insanely, and knocking over cars at fast speeds wasn't enough fun already (especially once you gain them and do improve + upgrade these abilities a bit), which all returns here in SR: GooH, BTW - the player can now also fly. Once the player learns how to fly + has leveled-up their character enough, the flying gets better and easier to handle. Oh, and it's a hell of a lot more fun, too! Flying is one of the best, coolest, and most fun new features in this game. Just exploring the sandbox of Hell itself and flying around it is pretty sweet, to say the very least.  While it took me 10 hours or so to finish my 1st playthrough (even though I did not do everything here), it certainly could take players a lot less time if they do not decide to keep on exploring the game-world and just do whatever activities they need to do to get fill up Satan's Wrath meter to get to the final encounter. It should be noted that there are actually multiple endings here, if you actually do feel up to experiencing the game more than one time through.  Saints Row: GooH is a very tough game to place somewhere b/c there are some cool + awesome things here, yet it feels like quite a bit is actually missing here. While that is to be expected with a stand-alone expansion or DLC, it still doesn't shake the feeling of how this could've turned out. With its crazy premise and many of the things this game has going for it, it could've been great. But, it's not - only having greatness in flashes of brillance, when it does. Maybe if Volition and High Voltage do feel up to it, they could offer up later some DLC (free and/or paid), to enhance + expand upon this experience.  For the time being, though: this game is certainly not worth the usual MSRP of $20 since there is hardly any main quests here; no real customization of your character's looks + outfits; and no real music here (licensed or not). On the other hand, it's certainly worth it if you can actually get this game really cheap, so you can check out the hilarious humor (which I wish there was more of); the new flying mechanics and gameplay is awesome (especially when you actually level-up your character); and there is the nice + cool new sandbox of Hell to explore.   Final Grade = C-.",

            "review_text": "I'm going to open this review with an analogy. Gat out of Hell is like the Weezer album 'Make Believe'. It's sell-out pop garbage and you're sitting there wondering what is happening to your favorite band, but all I'm thinking is: 'Well...The Green Album wasn't great either. I can't say that I'm surprised.' ...Ehh..Okay that doesn't really work. I don't listen to Weezer. Here's a much better analogy: Gat out of Hell is the equivalent of sneezing so hard that you crap your pants.  Look, I'm not critical of Saints Row because I get paid off by Rockstar, I do it because I'm passionate about the series. I've been here since the beginning, the demo for Saints Row 1 being the first game I played on my brand new Xbox 360. Even though I don't like Saints Row 4, I still applaud Volition for its success, they deserve it. However, it seems like no matter how low I set my expectations, Volition/Deep Silver have to find ways to disappoint me. Saints Row $: Gat out of Hell 44 1/4: All Saints go to Hell: The Final Insult is a blatant low-budget cash-grab. Here's a transcript from an actual* conversation at Volition.  Deep Silver: 'Sup? What are you working on?' Volition: 'Currently I'm developing content for a new Saints Row game.' Deep Silver: 'Excellent. What is it about?' Volition: 'Well, we decided to expand on what made SR4 so popular. This game is going to take place in Hell, and the Boss is going to have a lot of really unique demonic powers. There's also going to be this really good story, with lots of twists and turns. This is definitely going to be our biggest game yet.' Deep Silver: 'Hmm..About how far along are you?' Volition: 'Ehhh only 10% at best. Right now it's mostly just place-holder content.' Deep Silver: 'I see..*gasps* What in the world could that be!?' Volition: 'Huh?' Deep Silver: 'YOINK!' Volition: 'Hey! My workstation PC!'  High Voltage: 'Why are you giving me a PC?' Deep Silver: 'Just...do something with all this.'  Gat of Hell is a strictly Gat (and/or Kinzie) affair. The Boss has been kidnapped by Satan, and it's up to a couple of Mary Sues to save her. It seems odd that Kinzie would get involved, and not...Shaundi. Shaundi's been there for the boss since Saints Row 2. If I had to guess, it's because she doesn't have a personality. Anyway they arrive in Hell, get superpowers, and do a bunch of activities until the final boss battle unlocks. Note the word activities, there are no actual missions in this expansion. There are a few interactions with various 'wacky' characters like Vlad the Impaler and Shakespeare, but they don't amount to anything beyond cut-scenes and a lot of talking while you're exploring. While the city feels new and different enough, its inhabitants are soul-less husks. Yeah I know, eternal torment and all, but Hell still looks very much like an actual city. There are bars, clubs, and all sorts of other places to go, but they're all closed-off to you.   The chief superpower you receive in this game is the ability to fly. I...I actually can't hate on this at all. The flying in Gat Out of Hell is great. I loved soaring around, through narrow passages, diving, and even collected all 940 of those freakin' orbs. It's a damn shame that nothing is actually done with this ability. There aren't any missions, no enemies that specifically target flying Saints (aside from the lame spires), and all you really can do is stupid pet tricks like flying through hoops. While a few of Satan's minions can fly, Big Red never got the bright idea to finance some demonic flying vehicles to complement his tanks. The rest of the superpowers are reskins, and just like SR4 they are ridiculously over-powered. Satan himself isn't immune to the coldfire aura, he spent most of the final battle frozen. Several new weapons round out the Saint's arsenal. My personal favorite is Sloth. Nothing says effort like sitting back in a chair while twin-miniguns and rockets do all the work.   While is is appealing having 666 methods for wrecking adversaries, it all seems wasted due to the pitiful level of difficulty. Like most other gamers, I like big explosions and huge body-counts, but I also want to feel like they were earned. I want close-calls, near-deaths, or even just to be slightly threatened. I'll admit, I'd be happier if Saints Row went back to the early games, where explosive options were kinda limited. But if we're planning on sticking to this route, at least go all the way. If I'm going to be an ultimate badass, I want ultimate odds to match.   Actually, I take that back. I suddenly envisioned the end-game. Imagine a Saints Row MMO. It'd probably play like Marvel Heroes 2015 or DC Universe Online. It would take place in a bland feature-less city (like Steelport), and you'd create a Saint to go kill gang-bangers, aliens, and demons with dozens of dull super-powers. It'll be challenging only in the sense of 'you can't go here yet because you'll get one-shotted'. There would be all these quests with punny titles, and I'd probably be the only idiot wondering why I can't drive a car. I'd ask someone and they'd say 'Why would you drive a car?! You have super-sprint and flight already.'   It sounds ridiculous but what other conclusion can I draw? Saints Row has fallen into the trap of constant escalation. When your last game ended with the world getting blown up and the Saints getting a sweet space-ship and time-travel, you have to wonder what could possibly happen next. Well apparently it involved going to Hell, but that was basically wasted. What's next then? Do we just go back to thug-life and stealing cars? Or do we time-travel to the distant future to save neo-earth from the cyborg-dinosaurs? Nobody wants to get stuck with a pistol, when they can shoot lasers out of their finger-tips that cause massive explosions.   And yet with all that said, I've barely talked about Gat out of Hell. You know why? Because there's nothing to talk about. This expansion is for SR4 fans that want a change of scenery. If you've already played through SR4, play through it again and save some cash instead. All you're actually missing out on with this game is a half-baked city and the (really sweet) ability to fly. The activites are retreads or stupid stuff like hitting frat-demons through giant hoops. There aren't any missions, and all you ever really do is kill things. Sadly, that isn't even the worst part. There are those times when I actually want to mindlessly kill stuff, but then some Archduke(mini-boss) appears, all of the other demons leave, and I think to myself 'Maybe I should wait for the F2P Saints MMO'.  Oh! Before I forget. The cutscene before the final boss bugged out on me. I'm not sure how this got past testing.",

However, I am hoping, maybe, they come out with a DLC or two to fix what I feel this is missing. First I am and have been for awhile, a huge fan of the Saints Row Games. I have played from Saints Row 2 through this one, so I feel I do have some room to speak on it. If you just really want to have all the Saints Row games, or just really want to play a Saints Row styled game *say if you never played any of*, this is perfect. However it feels more like a demo than an actual part of the game itself.   Don't misunderstand, its still awesome and fun to play as well as a bit challenging for most of us, it just feels very limited to those of us who are familiar with the series already. I also understand that this was 'originally' being designed as a DLC for Saints Row 4 rather that a game in itself and I am sure all of this has been overstated already, but here's my pros and cons on it:  Pros: You can play as Johnny Gat 'Who doesn't want be Johnny Gat' and/or Kinzie Kensington *forgive me if I got her name wrong*, which is a bit of a surprise to me given her characters nature *I would have assumed either Shandi or Asha but it very cool to see Kinsie getting to play more or a role other than her typical one* .   I guess this is more for those of us familiar to the previous Saints Row games, but you get to meet some of the former characters from past games, like Daine *again forgive me if I misspelled the name, though I was surprised not to find Tanya anywhere and a bit shocked that both the twins are. Sorry if that was spoiler! XD * as well as you FINALLY get some justice on Dex for what he did to you and the Saints *just deserts I think*. Google or look it up on youtube if your unaware who any of these are, and you'll understand. XD   The story concept to me is 'out o the blue' so to speak. Not an idea I would have thought of or did I see coming with *without adding any spoilers* all that happens in Saints Row 4, so this is very cool *no pun intended XD *   Despite the smaller map size, its still fun and interesting to me to just freeroam and see things. I always loved that part in any game, and find it interesting in comparison to previous versions.   There's still a lot to do, again, despite the smaller map. I guess I'm a very 'slow' player because I tend to take my time doing everything, and I try to take in the full aspects as well as the content offered, be it just the overall astetics of the games design. I know the game itself only offers a few hours of actual game driven play, then one or two more with the side quest/missions, but if your like me and take your time playing, its still very rewarding, none the less.  Cons:  Not a big surprise to me given Johnny's signature outfit and looks, but no character customization, not even cloths? Rather sad I think considering the wide variety of outfits in most of the games thus far, and I looked forward to seeing what kind of outfits were going to be available in 'Hell', not to mention seeing Kinzie in some of the various outfits, if even the 'hell' versions of.   No hommies, gang members, crew to back you up or help *aka meat shields XD * which is also rather surprising to me in that I would have thought at least some of them would have went ....down Not up? XD None the less, its still rather disappointing.   No vehicle customization, which again is very sad and disappointing to me as I have always loved customizing and tweaking my vehicles, and which also has previously been available.   No vehicle saves/storage, also very sad and disappointing to me, considering previous versions, but being that there are no hommies thus no vehicle delivery or garages, and no customizations for them as well as the fact there are only like for or five types of vehicles in 'hell', and considering this is not another full Saints Row game, still I find this sad and disappointing.   No weapon customizations again leaving me feeling a bit dissapointed as i usually prefered the reskins version as to the standard skins.   No radios/radio stations, just the in game music itself. This really shocked me in a couple different ways. I have always loved the radios in the Saints Row games for the music and often for the commentaries *Zynak in Saints Row 4 comes to mind* not to mention I loved the added feel the music provided to the game experience so I was very shocked as well as disappointed about this one. Saints Row has always had some of the best in game music in my opinion.   No cheat codes. OK, this isn't a big issue to me, however I add it because when I get tired of doing the missions, quest, or roaming about I love turning them on and just creating overall havoc and destroying stuff just for fun, without having to worry about burning through my ammo, and getting killed, and just seeing the game mechanics as I run amock creating overall mayhem....its Just a thing to me. XD   No Genki... Now, I didn't expect a Murder Brawl, or M.O.M. or anything like that, but was rather disappointed not to see Professor Genki just roaming about as in Saints Row 4, which I thought would be both awesome and sensible because after all, he's Genki! XD   Only one safe house....again This isn't a big issue to me, considering Saints Row 4 *again trying not to add any spoilers*, but would be nice, none the less, to have more than just the one, even if the fact that you have no wardrobe or vehicle storage ability rather makes them pointless anyway, but still I find it a bit disappointing, even if the map itself isn't that big overall.   To wrap this up finally, I know this isn't meant to be Saints Row 5, nor was it designed to be, but again it feels very lacking and limited, and more like a demo of the actual game. Still despite all its fun and interesting.   Recommend.....at this time, no....simply due to what it lacks overall. As I said a few times, it feels more like a demo version of the game that you have to buy, rather than get free to try, and not a part of the game itself. Understanding though it was designed to be a DLC that they opted to make a stand alone, and not an actual game. Hopefully they may add more content to it and then I would recommend it, but unless you just want a lesser feel of Saints Row without having to buy the actual game, or just want it as part of the series, then not at this time.

The game has very few story missions, something I am sad to say. The story missions were always the best part of the Saints Row games, and leaving them out was a poor choice. The musical number in the middle of the game is enjoyable though. The new flight system is also unique and fun to use. All in all, sure it has a Saints Row feel to it, but it's not even close to being the caliber of the other games. This game should have been half priced if you ask me.",

No real story - Done what I thought were just introductory quests, yet I'm over 50% of the way through and what little story is present (In the unlikeable form of a 'narrated book') is dull and uninteresting. Similar to IV, a quest chain can be a list of activities rather than actual quests and some quest chains I questioned the purpose of. For example, everyone of the 'quest givers'/people who assist you, get captured all at once and you have to rescue them one after another, all in the same manner just different locations. It was incredibly easy, took less than 6-7 minutes to do the whole chain and served no real purpose to anything or anyone once completed. Real example of filler content.  Atmosphere is dead - Beside there being no music, the visual side of the game is dull as well. All pedestrians are the same old husks, cars are the same old rusty nails, places with loads of rocks and lava are just that - places with rocks and lava nothing else.   No homies - A mildly fun feature removed.   Powers - Only 1 new one and that is not exactly exciting to use. The rest are all the same as IV.  I feel the best way of describing this is simply -  'Saints Row IV reskinned with the life sucked out of it'  I loved all previous Saints Row games but this was a big disappointment for me.",
