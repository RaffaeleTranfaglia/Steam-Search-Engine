            "review_text": "My favorite flash game of all time, used to play the series over and over again when I was younger. I'm glad they brought it to steam, though I can't say I was expecting this at all. It's very hard for me to fairly rate this game without letting my nostalgia goggles get in the way, but I honestly think it's a very fun flash game with addicting (though not exactly deep) gameplay.  Graphics convey what they need to. Nothing more, nothing less. Soundtrack is generic elevator music, but it does fit the mood and doesn't get old. There's something about this game that is really satisfying, every time you eat something you get a nice little sound effect and see the grey blob grow a little. These small details add so much to the feel of the game and make it extremely comfortable to play. The price really isn't too bad considering a slightly inferior version of the game is (was?) being sold online for a few bucks more.  All in all I would recommend this game to people who grew up playing flash games online and want to experience the rush of completing level after level again.",

            "review_text": "Okay. If you have heard this game is like agar.io or slither.io or Spore.... It is! And it isn't!  You eat EVERYTHING! Some things hurt you back until you get big enough to get your OM NOM NOM NOM revenge! :D  Mouse controls have a similar sloppyish feel, keyboard controls are a wee bit better. But that all depends on what you are more comfortable with. Needs a little work perhaps, but not a game breaker. Especially in single player. Haven't tried a 2 player game yet. I suspect if the other player can attack me, it might be an issue. If you are a rhoid raging idiot when it comes to games like this. Don't see it being an issue for me. Unless the other player s my husband, and we use the game to settle a domestic dispute about leaving the toilet seat up at night. *ahem*  Game is just hilarious! Very campy, make me laugh my butt off the entre time. No dying, no pooping. Both +'s for me as an adult. But silly enough that kids and adults will enjoy this game. No difficulty level settings, but the 'badges' for time taken to complete each level let you challenge yourself.  ~*~*~ GAME DOES HAVE SOME CRASHING ISSUES DUE TO LAUNCH SETTINGS...SEE THE OFFICIAL STEAM FORUMS FOR THE EASY SOLUTION TO THIS (The Dev gave a solution to this in a number of threads on it, and it worked beautifully for me.)~*~*~*  If you like laughing while you play, need a way to trasfer that desire to clean out your kitchen to your PC (and keep you out of the kitchen...), enjoy a really campy look at Earth History...  Okay. If you like EATING EVERYTHING!!! This game is a blast! I expect to get a ton of playtime out of this, especially when I am stressed and need to just laugh. ALOT. :)",

It is great for the casual who is looking for a quick game to play, or someone who wants a challenge (there are medals that can be earned on levels, they are not required to progress, but can give a challenge to achieve). All in all, I recomend this to anyone.",
