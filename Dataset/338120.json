            "review_text": "   Marble Duel  is a matching game in which you play as Evy, a little girl which in the middle of the night steps inside a closet and finds herself in an unknown and fairy land. That said, having never played a game of this sort, I kind of went blind into this one.   One thing I noticed from the ground up was the fact that the   options menu is extremely lacking  . There is only the option to mute sound effects and music, no sliders to adjust the volume. As for the video options, the only thing you get is being able to choose what resolution you want to run the game on. For the type of game that is, maybe the only thing missing in video options would be v-sync and the ability to choose from windowed, windowed borderless and fullscreen. I was also kind of disappointed by the fact that the dialogue is not voice acted, even if there is little of it.    If you’ve played any matching games you’ll most likely feel at home   with this one. The concept is pretty simple, you arrive at this fantasy land and you progress through various areas, each with their own monsters. These areas are composed of various levels, each one representing an encounter with one of the monsters or some sort of mini-game. The combat in these encounters is turn-based, in the sense that you shoot spheres that you have and then it’s the enemy turn. However, you only start with 2 spheres per turn but by matching several colors in a row, you can gain more spheres for that turn.   Each sphere has its color, and each color has its own effect  . Red allows you to attack, green heals you, blue gives you a shield that absorves damage, purple increases the strength of your next attack and yellow allows you to reflect a portion of damage dealt by the enemy. The key in each of these encounters is to deplete the enemy life bar, and while this might feel easy at first, as the game progresses and as more spheres come into play the difficulty will rise. That said, sometimes I felt like the AI was cheating, in the sense that it would get the sphere it needed at the right time.  Depending on the amount of turns you take to beat a level you’ll be granted a bronze, silver or gold star. The better the star the more gems you’ll receive, and you can use these to upgrade your life, attack, healing and other abilities. If you want to get everything perfect, or if you get stuck on a level and need to upgrade your stats, you can replay previous levels. Still, you won’t gain more gems if you’ve already achieved that star rating previously.    Overall, I feel like what makes Marble Duel really worth playing (if this is your type of game), is the fact that you have the whole time of the world to make your move in what is already a very casual, satisfying and pleasant matching game. It is even more engrossing if you’re one of those that wants to get a perfect score on all the levels. The story is there, but it is skippable, even if the characters are unique and if the dialogue is nicely put together.  ",
