            "review_text": "Even if the graphics are not as best as they can be, this game for me is what VR is all about. Room scale exploration was invented for these types of games. This is the game I enjoyed most to be honest. I think 'quests' and room escapes are much more suitable for VR than timer based, you are in the middle, teleport style FPS games. I really forgot I was not in the room, this was fenomenal. I WANT MORE!",

            "review_text": "Short but brilliant. The whole point of the game is your stuck within a small room and you have one objective, getting out. To do so you must use your brain to find clues and solve puzzles. The visuals are nice and overall the game is really well put together. If you are a fan of real life escape rooms or even digital ones, pick up this game. Well worth the 5 bucks for the experience.",

            "review_text": "This was really well done. If you are a fan of escape rooms, I would definitely recommend it.  Yes, admittedly, it is short. It is one small room with a normal mode and a bonus mode. It took me a little under 45 minutes to complete both. (If you have no experience with escape rooms, it might take longer.)  However, compared to the price of an actual escape room (usually around $30 per person for an hour max), $5.00 is nothing.   Also, I thought using a very small room as the dev did was very effective and kept everything within your reach. Very immersive.  All in all, I enjoyed my time and look forward for another release from this creator. Thanks.",

            "review_text": "The puzzle is a bit easy, and picking up stuffs from the floor can be hard. So do not throw everything off to the floor. :) overall, it is a very pleasant experience. Hopefully, in the future, the room can be larger, with some teleportation function.",
