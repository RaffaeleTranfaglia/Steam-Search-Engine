The character you are playing with is quite entertaining with little repetitive messages and the game has high potential to be extremely frustrating. The character is highly sympathic so despite only knowing him for a few minutes you get attached to him really quickly, giving it a lot of potential to be story rich. The last level you can play in this intro kinda makes me curious if its possible to implement psychological horror aswell, since the game reflects really good how Kevin is kept in complete solitude and void, while having no one but you (and Maggie).  Please game devs, focus on the story of this game. Build in a few sick minded turns and spice it up a bit. The story could be breathtaking, the gameplay itself should be challenging too, but it will get boring if the story wont match. And keep it dark.",

I ended up killing him multiple times, and at first, he was patient, but then he wanted to start getting lippy and making threats to pull the plug on the game. He said if I killed him one more time, that was it...but did he offer any guidance how to get him through that tricky part? No.   So I killed him.  And he rage quit.  He rage quit so hard, I can't even try to start the game again...it crashes every single time on start up now.  Kevin's a bit of a pansy. I guess he'll be stuck in the game forever.   Kevin, if you see this: Help me help you.",
