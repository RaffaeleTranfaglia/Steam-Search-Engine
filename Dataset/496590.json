You have to kill the enemies with the right color and the most difficult part, it is when the ennemies are a combination of the basic colors... you have to find which colors are right to kill them.  The story? The Universe is in danger, Chaos became stronger and kicked you in the ♥♥♥. You are playing the Law, you need to train, to learn more tricks and when you will be ready, you will push Chaos to its place and find the right balance for the Universe.  ",
