            "review_text": "I was first sceptical, especially after the first few playthroughs but I'm a sucker for upgrades when done right and slowly but surely I became stronger and next thing I knew a 10 minute play session turned into two hours and now I'm hooked. If you like planet hopping physics and planting seeds to make planets grow (and give you health) then this is for you. I'm a 33 year old male and find it hard to get into games the older I get, even though I still love them. So, if you find yourself in the same boat and are looking for a casual game where you die often (and that's okay) then this is for you! Anyway, I'm not great at writing reviews, this is my first one. I liked the game that much I felt compelled to come here and tell you all that I love it!",

            "review_text": "This game has a very original idea (healing planets by planting seeds on them), nice graphics and music, and a very enjoyable exploration side. Sadly, the gameplay is not good, so the game manages to be frustrating without being difficult - most of the time I'm just ignoring enemies (and ignoring being hit) because destroying the enemies is boring and pointless. Weapon upgrades are pointless as well, since when you get hit you lose them and most of the times they are not worth recovering. And above all, the game is very repetitive after a while. It's not that bad, but having to choose between yes and no, I'd rather not recommend it.",

I like to sum up my 8 hour journey:   I wake up butt-naked on a planet with a fish bowl and a laser gun Placed seeds on the planet like i was a farmer Shot down aliens like the american sniper Went to explore another planet like NASA Made small pyramids that shoot lasers from it's eye=illuminati? Fought a dragon like a knight, but with a gun all around space Found an egg and kept it with me Then it started to hatch on a planet that had the same color as the egg Monsters came and attacked at me like crazy, it was like mission impossible It hatched, and what did I see? A turtle, and I named him Mr. Wiggles Me and Mr. Wiggles continued our journey together But then, I flew too far to the end, and killed myself and Mr. Wiggles R.i.p Mr. Wiggles :(  10/10 game, it is very unique and entertaining (11/10 if you bring me Mr. Wiggles back :(......)

It's lighthearted and one of those roguelikes that chooses to let you learn to play on your own rather than hold your hand - a sentiment that strikes me as particularly ironic considering that the protagonist starts as a spaceman in his underwear.  Very enjoyable, albeit, somewhat short lived and singular in purpose. Worth playing.",

            "review_text": "After putting lots of time into this game it would likely be more enjoyable, but as is it is too slow, and not very entertaining.   Second look: I replayed the game after there has been many updates. I mostly stand by what I've said. This is a bit more than a flash game, the developer is definitley DEVELOPING the game. The map is lovely, it's nice to see what places have already been settled. Also I'd say this game certainly has more merit as a casual game. Slowly progressing through the improvement system and going through the story, which admittedly I haven't had the patience to do, is likely a rewarding experience. I'd like to elaborate on the VERY SLOW part. RPG elements, and taking a long time to progress because you need upgrades is fine, I just don't prefer those sort of games. My problem with this game is building. Sitting still and planting for a couple seconds is just frusteratingly slow. If we could drop the seeds and watch them auto grow that would be much better. I recognize that may cause planets to get inhabited too quickly, but you could make the gameplay more interesting by growing plants being vulnerable to bullets.   I will keep trying this game as it is updates. I like the how the developer treats his community, and I'd really like to change this reccomendation to a yes.   ~Zee",

            "review_text": "I'm still not sure how to pronounce this game, but the game play is just as hard if not harder. If you like a challenge, floating lost around space, shooting aliens and growing plants, this is the game for you.  The basic idea it to recreate a planets atmosphere by planting seeds and defending it from aliens. After you have restored a planet, that planet will repay you by giving you its heath so you (hopefully) save the next planet without dying.  As well as planting seeds, you can build defences to automate your defence against the aliens and try to get through the storyline without dying. This game has no checkpoints, once you die, you die. I've never got past saving about 5 planets in one game, as I said, this game is HARD.   So, in conclusion, if you don't mind restarting every time you die, and want to shoot aliens while planting trees to save planets, sure, get this game.",
