            "review_text": "'Hospital Park Trespasser: Surgeon Became Archer Edition'  Concept is good but controls are awful. Unnecessarily hard and trying over and over to nock the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it arrow and mostly can't shoot things is ruining the game. They have to change the both-hands-elbow-shoulder-controls to something else. Otherwise this is literally bull♥♥♥♥.  In the real life, this is easier than this. Because you don't need to think about what key to press to use your respective muscles.  I don't expect them to change controls but if there will be good update about controls, i'll try the game again and edit this review. Right now, not recommended.   EDIT:  Still, I don't recommend this game but since the last update, there are simplified elbow controls and nock assist. At least developers still updating the game and listening demands of players. Good to see this, keep it up guys.",

It makes manipulating your wrists and arms very complicated, and that's bad considering this is an aiming game. You know why is there no option to change this? BECAUSE ARTIFICIAL DIFFICULTY.  &gt;Every time you shoot and then grab a new arrow, your right arm does not go back to its previous position. It insists on going somewhere else, and you have to fiddle around with your elbow and wrist controls just to nock the arrow again; AND if you don't position your hand exactly like you did on your previous shot (which is very likely), you will have nocked the arrow in a completely different direction and now you either have to redo it or have to adjust your left arm holding the bow to compensate, which is just as annoying.  The game would probably be fun if you're extremely good with the controls, but it is not at all worth the effort to get to that level. I really believe this game would have been great, but the controls are just really bad. No, don't think that they're challenging, they are just bad. Unplayable bad.  CONCLUSION: DON'T GET THIS GAME",

The terrible controls make it impossible to play most of the game modes since they are either timed or have something running fast at you. It is nothing like Surgeon Simulator 2013 (SS)! Not even close. In fact, it makes SS 2013 seems easy to play next to this game! The controls are that bad. No funny bad either! Just BAD!!!  The Zombie soccer can be fun in short spurts, but only because there is a pistol to shoot with way limited ammo, but the controls to kick the ball suck, so that's hard to play also. Plus there are too many zombies and the screen starts to skip at about 3 fps sometimes, no matter what the screen resolution is set at!  Again, the controls for the bow are so bad, it makes the game unplayable at times! It takes you forever to adjust the bow just to be able to put the arrow in the string!!! It's really, really bad!!! I cannot recommend this came to anyone unless you like to get frustrated!!!  Here are my system specifications: iMac, i5 Quad-Core Intel processor 3.1GHZ, AMD Radeon HD 6970M with 1GB dedicated video RAM, 4GB system RAM, 1TB hard drive running OS X version 10.6.8.",
