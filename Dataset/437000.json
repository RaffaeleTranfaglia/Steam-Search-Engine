            "review_text": "- Review in French below / Version française en-dessous -   No, this is not a Guilty Gear fighting game. No, this is not a Warriors-like (Dynasty Warriors...) game either. Yes, in its current state, this port can be slightly buggy and rough around the edges.  So, what is it? Well, it's hard to describe. It's some kind of MOBA with minion control mixed with a beat 'em all. It can sound awkward, but it does feel original. I will probably update my review when I have finished the game (or even before), but right now, it is a good game in my opinion. Also, note that this game, while not a fighting game in the Guilty Gear series, is just as canon as Xrd or Vastedge (which is not a fighting game either). Because yes, it introduces some characters and concepts that are mentioned and used in Xrd. I also suspect that Guilty Gear 2 has evolved through time in such a way that it give birth to Guilty Gear Xrd, hence their link story-wise. The music is pretty nice, especially the battle themes (the ones that play when you fight another master) : these were composed by Daisuke Ishiwatari, the composer of... well, almost all of the Guilty Gear soundtracks, actually. The rest of the music you can hear in the rest of the game was composed by someone else, and since I haven't read the credits, I don't know who it is, sorry.  Should you buy it now? That all depends on what you want.    If you want a fighting game, that's not it.    If you want a game with an original gameplay, you should try it. |*]If you want to learn more about the GG lore, you might want to play it as long as you like the gameplay itself (else you might just want to watch a playthrough).   If you want a game with the latest graphics, this game doesn't have them; it's merely a port from a 2007 game right now, and some graphics options and tweaks are coming in the next updates, such as fullscreen and resolution settings. Also, you must know that there are some issues right know, with the depth of field and bloom settings being setup incorrectly,  resulting in blur and too much brightness  and the first update disabled DoF. This, too, should be corrected soon since the console release didn't have this problem.   If you want a polished port (which you could expect from Arc System Works), you should come back in two weeks or so until all the major quirks are fixed, such as full keyboard (and mouse) support, all the DLC included natively (because it will, but right now it is missing) and ranked matches. And the 'exit game' function has been added, which is very welcome.   If you trust ArcSys with this port (or want the music that's included), you should grab it, during sales or not.   Overall, a pretty good game, but a port missing quite a lot of features at the time I'm writing this.    - Version française -  Non, ce n'est pas un jeu de baston Guilty Gear. Non, ce n'est pas un jeu Warriors-like (Dynasty Warriors...). Oui, dans son état actuel, ce portage peut être bugué et sérieusement manquer de polish.  Donc qu'est-ce que c'est? Eh bien c'est assez difficile à décrire. C'est un genre de MOBA avec un contrôle sur les sbires, les creeps, les larbins (appelez-les comme vous voudrez) mélangé avec un beat 'em all. Ca peut sembler bancal dit comme ça, mais c'est en réalité plutôt original. Je mettrai sans doute cette évaluation à jour quand j'aurai fini le jeu (ou même avant), mais pour l'instant, je trouve que c'est un jeu plutôt bon. Aussi, notez que même si ce n'est pas un jeu de baston dans la série Guilty Gear, il fait tout autant partie du canon que Xrd ou Vastedge (qui, lui non plus, n'est pas un jeu de bourre-pif). En effet, il introduit certains personnages et concepts mentionnés et réutilisés dans Xrd. D'ailleurs, je suppose que Guilty Gear 2 a tellement évolué au cours du temps qu'il a fini par donner naissance à Guilty Gear Xrd, d'où leur relation au niveau de l'histoire. La musique est plutôt sympathique, notamment les thèmes de combat (ceux qui se lancent quand vous affrontez un autre 'maître') : ils ont été composés par Daisuke Ishiwatari, le compositeur de... ben à peu-près tout le reste de la musique de Guilty Gear. Le reste de la musique du jeu a été composé par quelqu'un d'autre, et étant donné que je n'ai pas encore lu les crédits, je ne sais pas de qui il s'agit, désolé.  La question fatidique : devriez-vous l'acheter maintenant? Tout dépend de ce que vous voulez.    Si vous voulez un jeu de baston, ce n'en est pas un.    Si vous voulez un jeu au gameplay original, vous devriez l'essayer.   Si vous voulez en savoir plus sur l'univers de Guilty Gear, vous pouriez avoir envie d'y jouer, à condition d'apprécier le gameplay (sinon vous pourriez aussi juste vouloir regarder des playthroughs).   Si vous voulez un jeu au top des graphismes, ce n'est pas ici; c'est juste un portage d'un jeu de 2007 en l'état actuel, et certaines options graphiques et des réglages arriveront dans les prochaines mises à jour, comme le mode plein écran ou des options de résolution. Aussi, vous DEVEZ savoir qu'il y a quelques problèmes avec cette version, avec la profondeur de champ et le bloom mal réglés,  résultant en un écran flou ou trop lumineux selon les conditions  et la profondeur de champ a été désactivée avec la première mise à jour. Ceci aussi devrait être corrigé bientôt étant donné que la version console n'avait pas ce problème.   Si vous voulez un portage bien fini (ce que vous pourriez attendre d'Arc System Works), vous devriez repasser dans deux semaines ou quelque part par là, d'ici à ce que tous les gros problèmes soient corrigés, comme le support clavier (et souris) complet, tous les DLCs inclus nativement (parce que oui ils vont l'être, mais là ils ne sont pas présents) et les matchs classés. Aussi, la fonction 'quitter le jeu' a été ajoutée, ce qui est bienvenu ('jeu de sortie' à son déploiement pour l'anecdote).   Si vous avez confiance en ArcSys pour ce portage (ou que vous voulez la musique fournie avec), vous devriez le prendre, durant les soldes ou en-dehors.   Globalement, un jeu plutôt bon, mais un portage auquel manque un bon paquet de fonctionnalités à l'heure où j'écris ces lignes, Notez aussi que le jeu est dispo avec le texte en Français, c'est toujours bon à savoir (même si je joue avec le texte en Anglais, donc je ne peux pas juger de sa qualité.",

            "review_text": "Do you have to be a hardcore anime fan to get into the game? Most likely. If you're a casual gamer is it possible to get into it? Yes, as the concept may entice you or may confuse you.  Guilty Gear 2 -Overture- follows other anime concepts with some insane 3D attack combinations and visuals to go along with it. This is the bread and butter of the game play. I'm not completely familiar with the guilty gear series but I'll try to give you the best low-down I can. You play as a character (mainly) named Sol who is a Gear. Gears apparently have abilities to use magic as they were formed from smaller molecular magical parts. The rising action begins when 'sleeping' Gears begin vanishing from a Kingdom and therefore attempts to reach out to Sol as he's under attack by a mysterious foe. This foe later turns out to be some weird girls wearing some questionable clothing.  Guilty Gear follows mainly an over the shoulder 3rd person camera of Sol. Sol is able to attack whomever he pleases and can move around the map freely. His basic attack is X but can be mixed in with other combinations (such as pointing the left stick up/down/left/right) to add different effects. Magic attacks can be thrown into the mix by using &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Y&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; but a certain amount of mana is needed before you can let loose and go nuts. Sol also has the ability to dash (pressing A twice) and can jump (by pressing A). He is capable of sprinting at a variable speed depending on how much you crank the left thumb stick. Sprinting is a bit difficult as turning can prove to be a challenge. This is neither good nor bad as it just takes a bit of time getting used to. Sol can literally 'drift' while he is running to make sharp turns.  The main premise of the game is essentially an over the shoulder fight game with mixed elements of strategy. I've done some research on reviews and found a vast mix of opinions. Some like the layout this particular game took as it didn't follow the traditional GG setup. Some didn't like it as they couldn't quite figure out if the game was this or if the game was that (I'm going to judge the game as I see it). To me, it seems that they've taken a tower defense game and added an attack option. This attack option largely consists of you controlling Sol in order to take out the opponents 'Masterghost' (or the main structure that will lead to your victory). Smaller structures can be taken over to collect additional mana and create additional units. Sol may hit these structures in an attempt to take them over quicker. By default, each tower spawns units. These units don't really attack one another but seem to count for 1 hit point each. If your unit collides with another enemy unit, chances are they will cancel one another out (unless a unit has been upgraded). Unfortunately, the player does not have control over these upgrades and is done automatically. A missed opportunity; they could have given the player more directive by giving them control over this. Sol can sort of control his own 'robot' specialty units (each character have their specific set of specialty units). He can 'pack' them into his inventory and release them where he pleases on the map.  The inventory can be accessed by simply pressing 'B' to activate the selected inventory. This can range from units, to specialty objects (used against bosses) and other miscellaneous power ups. The player can swap between inventory by pressing RB or LB. 6 slots are available and power ups can be found all around the map randomly. The  game play  itself is good at first, but can slowly start getting redundant to some player. I can see the animations that are associated with the attacks attracting players back to the game but I can see a lot of players walking the other way after completing a few missions. Either way, the game does have a solid story line to it if players are willing to watch the cut-scenes.  The  visuals  in the game are of xbox 360 quality and could have been upgraded for the PC port. The graphics themselves are not too bad and the background scenery is pretty good. Most of the animations are full and have a lot of effects. They definitely tried their best in including all sorts of creatively designed characters and enemies. The  sounds  are actually really authentic. They kept the entire game in Japanese (with English subtitles) which I think is great. I have no idea what they are saying but sounds cool. I'm sure players will enjoy the voice acting. The actual battle sounds are good but I can see some players becoming agitated from hearing the same dialogue (in-game) or impact sounds.  Overall, it's neither a good game nor bad game. I think it's something that someone can relate and become interested in the story which leads to playing the game. The game play itself is pretty cool and the concept they tried makes the game a unique one at that. The only game I think comes close to this concept is Sacrifice but you can't really attack physically with your character. I will recommend this game  but with great caution. I would highly recommend it if you see on sale for a solid price !

            "review_text": "Guilty Gear 2 -OVERTURE- is a unique entry into the world of the Guilty Gear fighting franchise. Originally released in 2007 on the Xbox 360, the game was neither popular with fans, critics, or newcomers to the series. The game itself combines elements of hack n' slash with real time strategy (RTS), all the while portraying an underlying multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) influence. Needless to say, the move from 2D side scrolling fighting to 3D RTS/MOBA was a massive shock for audiences.  I personally did not play GG2 -OVERTURE- when it was first released, so I was excited when I saw it come to Steam; I've been excited about every Guilty Gear release on Steam thus far, as I thought it would never happen. The thing is, I never really researched the game, which I will admit is partially my fault. However, the trailer on the store page is one of the most useless trailers in gaming history, and the screenshots led me to believe that the game was going to be similar to Dragon Quest Heroes or Dynasty Warriors. Sadly, this is not the case, and I am personally not a fan of RTS/MOBA genres.  Despite that, there is still the lingering, burning question; is the title any good for an RTS/MOBA game? Unfortunately, absolutely not, the gameplay is downright boring and you will have pretty well experienced everything it has to offer within the first hour of playing. As is typical with MOBAs, you have a Master Ghost (home base) that you need to defend with your units, which you can capture and make more of by taking control of normal Ghosts (spawn points). You continue down a linear path to the enemy Master Ghost and wipe it out. Also, as what is typical for RTS games, you control units to battle other units, all the while hack n' slashing your way to the enemy base. Rinse and repeat for every level, and there you have Guilty Gear 2 -OVERTURE-.  On top of it all, the story is majorly confusing... even for seasoned Guilty Gear veterans such as myself, much less someone who is new or casual to the franchise. The visuals are decent enough, given the fact that they're nearly a decade old; although I do have a hard time understanding why portions of the game have a hazy blur to them. As well, it's a prime time to note that Guilty Gear 2 -OVERTURE- does not have any graphic options at all. You can go fullscreen, however, by pressing F11.  In truth, the only things that Guilty Gear 2 -OVERTURE- have going for it are the abundance of modes to play in, however boring they may become, and an outstanding soundtrack that the franchise has come to be known for. If you go in expecting something like Dynasty Warriors or Dragon Quest Heroes, you're going to be sorely disappointed, so make sure to research further than the store page. If you're a fan of RTS/MOBA games, you may enjoy this game more, but beware of its repetitive nature, and massively linear gameplay. All in all, even for hardcore fans of the Guilty Gear series, I would have to give this one a pass. At least it runs at a solid 60 FPS.   Rating:  2.5/5.0  - It's not awful, but it's not great.",

            "review_text": "EDIT - Just a heads up that I played this game on Xbox 360 in June 2009 and my play hours listed are nowhere near indicative of my Experience with it.  I collect Action RTS games and wish they were not a niche genre. Unfortunately, not even that could get me to enjoy Guilty Gear's venture into the genre. Which is a shame because I tried really hard to like it. This game borrows a few things from DOTA, but the fact that you can build and command units sets it into Action-RTS hybrid territory.  MAPS: This games takes the map design from DOTA a little too literally, translating poorly for an action game. You get the same 3 to 4 tight corridors for you and your units to march in. But you, as a hero unit, need to be able to move much more quickly, so there is a dash mechanic in which you 'anime ninja dash' through these tight quarters. If you bump into an enemy, or hit a wall, you crash, and crash hard. It makes something as simple as changing lanes a nightmare. This is the reason I dislike the game more than anything else.  Units: You can build units with Rock Paper Scissors properties. A lot of them have really cool designs and they communicate with you when they encounter enemies, and let you know if they have an advantage or not. Other than that, they trade hits with each other like Dynasty Warriors, and its your job to support them. Unlike DOTA 'creeps' are helpless units with 1HP that cancel each other out and only exist to capture Ghosts (resource nodes.) Its boring, but non-intrusive and effective. In order to command them, you have to go to an entirely different screen called The Organ, where you can build and command units. This means you have to leave to a safe area before you can issue commands. Its clunky and frustrating.  Music: I only bought the game for the soundtrack. Daisuke Ishiwatari once again put away the drum machine and got a live drummer for the character tracks. However, you won't hear most of it in the game. Generic synth orchestras play through most of the story, one 'encounter' song for when hero units clash, and a handful of metal songs to go with some important moments. Do yourself a favor and actually listen to the attached OST, and hear what you’re missing!  Hero Units: The game leans a bit too far into Dynasty Warriors. Each hero unit can pull off some long, absurd wombo-combos, and characters from the fighting games have their moves retained. But these can be time consuming, to the point of being tiresome. They pull your eyes away from the overall battlefield and unit status. To traverse long distances, you can 'anime ninja dash' through the area, but like I said in Maps, its easily the worst part of the game.  Story: I enjoy the story very much. And if you like Guilty Gear's story and setting, this is the game that FINALLY pulled the story out of the quagmire that GGX2 set. GGX2 was so done to death that it can be summarized of every character telling every other character 'get out of my way.' GG2 takes places a few years after GGX2. The world is running out of meaningful bounties to hunt, as Gears go extinct (or so the world thinks), so bye-bye Bridget and Jam (finally!) Ky goes through some big changes, and steps aside for a new main character, Sin. Gears replace bounty hunters as the focus of the story, revealing they have their own communities and beliefs toward the world. And the source of Magic in the world of GG is revealed. Sol's nemesis, That Man, reveals hints at Sol's destiny, and a new tragic villain, the first Valentine, is revealed. And there is one EPIC finally battle in which Sol finally rises up and shows us why he is the main character of the story. Its enough, at this price, to justify a single playthrough.  I think that the developers, like most who want to venture into the cursed, obscure Action RTS genre, thought they were the first to come up with an Action RTS hybrid, and not look at the graveyard of such games that it left behind. Battlezone and Sacrifice were wonderful games that nobody bought. Instead we have this mess of a game that can't compete. If you want to play one of the best Action RTS games from this era, play Brutal Legend instead. It resolves every major problem I have with GG2.",
