And time has not diminished how much fun it is to play. The game took me about 8 hours to complete the story (and another 2 derping around trying to complete other objectives).   However there are some downsides. I noticed a few frame rate drops here and there, but noting too major. Aswell as afew other bugs that didnt effect the gameplay that much. The graphics... Its a ps2 game. But you slowly notice how it looks less and less, and just start enjoying the game for what it is.   Would I recomend this game to someone who had never played it as a kid? No, not unless they like the collectathon format. But that shouldnt stop new poeple from discovering this game.",
