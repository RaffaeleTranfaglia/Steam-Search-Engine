            "review_text": "The game is good. I usually start being sceptic when I see great graphics on a visual novel. I mean, if you got no story, you might try to lure people with great artwork and music. And in the end the visual nove experience becomes a great disappoinment. Because the content is not good. Not here though. This is an exceptional game, made with a lot of devotion and love. As a gamer I can tell. As a developer I can tell too. The game visual art is unique and superb and it collaborates in harmony with particles used. I really feel the struggle not to overdo it there. The music is simple as it should be. It is magnificent and fits well with the whole artwork, helping you dive in the game world, like the water helps you slide on a waterslide. The sound fx are great too. I just want to mention some volume differences that might seem odd to some people, specifically barking dogs could be a little less loud than they are, but that was not a critical mistake or something. I am currently in Chapter 2, making decisions all the time and taking a branch of the story. Almost all the characters are well thought and placed to the story, I feel that the two protagonists are forced by fate to meet each other, but on the other hand it is GREAT novelty and cool idea to see things by two people than one. I really have enjoed the game so far and I believe that it deserves your attention. I find the price of 18 Euro a little odd for a visual novel, but thinking of the business, the people involved and the end result, it seems like a decent price. If you are a fan of visual novels and play the game through the many branches, I believe it will worth the price and for sure, even playing it once, it seems a great experience. I will update the review after finishing it. ",

            "review_text": " Solstice  is a solid visual novel that invites the player into the walls of the beautiful but unforgiving Jewel of the North, a secluded city located in the snowy landscapes of the far north. Moacube, who are well-known by visual novels fans for their previous work  Cinders , managed, in my opinion, to reutilize what made  Cinders  great (the characterization of the characters being the strongest point here) but also delved more deeply into storytelling and the ramifications of choices and consequences.  Solstice ’s scenario is pretty unpredictable but thoroughly enjoyable, and the conclusion didn’t disappoint me.  The player plays as two characters, Galen, the humourous doctor who hides more secrets that it seems, and Yani, a young and ambitious engineer. It is to be noticed that the choices have a considerable influence not only on the outcome of the story, but also on the personality of the protagonists and their relationships, both between them and with the rest of the characters. The effort put into the creation of a varied and overall strongly written cast of characters (a dozen) is to be appreciated as well, even if some could have been used more efficiently.  I feel like the journal entries (Galen and Yani write down important information about the characters and places they meet so the player doesn't forget it later in the story) deserve a special mention, as it provides us with a well-thought and useful upgrade from  Cinders 's time.  What else can be said ? The art is gorgeous (with these little motion-effects that are applied to certain objects in the background and help to create an entrancing atmosphere), and the soundtrack absolutely amazing. I would recommend it to anyone who would like to try a visual novel and of course to the fans of the genre. There are also a lots of achievements and different endings which give good replay value.  The only criticism I could give to  Solstice  concerns one of the two romance paths (Yani’s one), which seemed really dull and forced to me. I took absolutely no pleasure playing it, and it is surprising considering that the other one was well-done and quite emotional. It shouldn’t prevent anyone from trying out the game, though !",
