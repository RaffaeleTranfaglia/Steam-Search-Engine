            "review_text": "I would recommend that you play at least Tomoyo's route in CLANNAD or watch the Tomoyo OVA to understand the basic background of the characters, since there is quite a lot of it and you wouldn't enjoy the visual novel as much as someone who played or watched CLANNAD.  Tomoyo After ~It's a Wonderful Life~ English Edition is a visual novel about family and love. To be more precise it's about trying to overcome hardships and trying to find happiness with your loved one. Can love be eternal? Can it cause only suffering? Can you overcome the pain and suffering and will you end up happily ever after?  A few months have passed since the events from CLANNAD. After finishing high school Tomoya starts living alone in an small apartment and he's working as a garbage collector/repairman. He's being supported by Tomoyo, who is still going to high school, but in her free time she cooks, takes care and spends her time with Tomoya. Later Tomoyo's younger brother Takafumi brings a young girl named Tomo to the apartment. It turns out that Tomo is the illegitimate child of Tomoyo's father which was abandoned by her mother in front of Tomoyo's and Takafuni's house. To avoid more trouble they decide that Tomo will stay in Tomoya's apartment for the time being while they look for her mother. After a while Takafumi's ex-girlfriend Kanako join too and they all start spending their time together in Tomoya's apartment.  The seiyuu (voice actors), our main character Tomoya Okazaki is voiced by Nakamura Yuuich which some of you will recognize from BlazBlue (Hazama and Yuuki Terumi), Tomoyo Sakagami is voiced by Isshiki Hikaru (Sakaki Yumiko from Grisaia), Tomo by Sasaki Akari and Kanako and Takafumi are both voiced by Suzumori Chisato (Hoshino Yumemi from Planetarian). My favourite character was Kanako, I don't know why but her boyish attitude and jokes always made me laugh or giggle.  The translation is quite good and this time Key didn't use Sekai Project to publish their visual novel, instead they did it themself while the transaltion was done by Waku Productions, which used the fan translation from Doki (the guys who sub anime) if you didn't know.  The soundtrack, like most soundtracks from Key, is great. It fits perfectly to every scene and the characters mood. The music pieces that stood out for me were: ''Hope'', ''Love Song'' and ''Dear Old Home.''  A turn based RPG can be played in this visual novel, it's called Dungeons &amp; Takafumis, it's a fun little game in which you take control of the games characters and you clear floors from enemies. It's filled with comedy dialogue, funny item descriptions, lots of skills and a few easter eggs for CLANNAD fans.  It took me about 12 hours to finish reading while getting 3 bad endings in between. Depending on your luck and skill, you can double that time with playing Dungeons &amp; Takafumis while trying to get all achievements.  Overall I can recommend Tomoyo After ~It's a Wonderful Life~ English Edition not only to any Key or CLANNAD fan, but also to any visual novel fan who is looking for a heartwarming romance/drama with a handful of comedy mixed in the first half of it.",
