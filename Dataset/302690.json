I don't usually play point and click games, but this one got my attention and the story is pretty dang spiffy to boot! I mean what would a point and click adventure be without story I guess? It's also on sale for it's first week on steam (Basically, seeing as it's supposed to be on sale for 6 days, 6 hours and 6 minutes at 66% off!) I mean. Not to say this needs to be on sale, I'd happily buy it full price. I just happened to stumble upon it on its first day on Steam.  I'm looking forward to this studios future works.  (After Finishing the game) This game gives you everything you need to finish the story. You just have to pay attention! A lot of 'Aha!' moments I must say. The ridiculousness of the story is so great and charming, the ending? Wowzers I cannot wait to see where it goes! A few sad moments in the story too...",

You play as Malcolm, a heavy metal loving teen. And when your car crashes outside a medical building at the beginning of a zombie outbreak, you must make your way through the building with your zombie buddy Ronnie to uncover the mystery as to why this apocalypse has suddenly occured. Don't let the look of this game fool you, it's actually extremely challenging and very well thought out. Each task you have to complete will take time, thought, and effort as you scout this building from bottom to top looking for the answer. Along the way you'll meet some really funny and entertaining characters, and will always be wondering what the next room will hold.  This game gets a solid 9 - 10 from me. BUY IT!",

Some were a bit easy. The graphics were rather functional for the most part, but there was effort put into them and you got used to the art style quickly. All in all I enjoyed playing this game a lot and I'd recommend it to everyone who likes crude humor and can take some graphic scenes (don't worry- it's all cartoony and rather funny than terrifying). Also, metal lovers will like it even more.",

Succeeding with AGS demands a lot from the writing department, and this is where Metal Dead shines.  The story follows the exploits of two metalheads in the middle of an zombie outbreak, and is just about as anarchistic that can be imagined from the premise. The game does not skimp on the gore, but it's all presented with a deftly light and funny touch and endearingly crude graphics. In fact, the game's sense of humor is its strongest asset: The dialogue and writing is generally quite funny and pokes a lot of fun at various pop and alternative culture phenomenons.  The puzzles are surprisingly logical as well, which does mean the game is a bit on the easy side. I don't really see that as a negative thing, however - It keeps the narrative moving and the jokes incoming, and Metal Dead is above all entertaining throughout its duration. It's not quite as laugh-out-loud funny as the Ben &amp; Dan games, but worth experiencing nevertheless. Rough on the outside, but beats a lot of the generic adventure bulk put out by actual publishers with ease.",

            "review_text": "So Metal Dead is initially a pretty cool looking game for fans of metal, a standard zombie apocalypse title set apart by its metal-loving protagonists so much so that the very title is a play on 'metalhead'. Unfortunately however it doesn't really live up to this promise either as a game or as a humorous take on the genre and subculture. The game itself is only a few hours long which for the price is about right, but during those three or so hours it doesn't really do much. Your character simply progresses from room to room picking up items and collecting elevator access cards from other characters in a rather dull manner with uninteresting and sometimes annoying controls, making for a rather drab playing experience. This could easily be at least partially salvaged by the story, aesthetic or humour the game clearly aims for but it doesn't really nail this either. Jokes are very surface level and basic but lacking the raw punch to actually produce real laughs. It has a couple of mild smirk-worthy moments, but nothing inspiring anything more and a couple of comments made by characters are somewhat questionable. Dialogue isn't exactly invigorating, characters are stereotypical without actually making jabs at those too much, and most disappointingly of all the comical look at metal itself it seems to suggest is nothing to write home about. Once in a while the two main characters will refer to something as 'brutal' in a Metalocalypse-esque fashion and South Park-ish usage of metal to drive away enemies is central to the climax (in fairness the root explanation of the zombie apocalypse is more creative than many, if a little random), but anything beyond that which would resonate with members of that subculture is painfully lacking, and an ending comment by one character on how using image to define yourself and your deeds is no worse than being mindless undead just comes across as tacked on, ill thought out and a little preachy with absolutely nothing coming prior to set up or question the issue. Ultimately it's not an awful way to spend a small handful of hours especially for the price but where there was potential to make something unique, entertaining and memorable there's a merely serviceable game with underwritten jokes and subtext and a whiff of missed opportunity.",

The music... yeah... 8-Bit (which is nice!) but talking about Metal ... disappointing (there are much older 8-Bit games that can do this much better!? why not reference to that?) Sounds effect... could be made much better... but yeah sure why not... Achievements? Cool!  Gamecontrol... yeah... you can play! but come on... in 2014 that should be made better! (Ever played a LucasArts?) Gameplay... 4 hours Story time. Impressive and absolut ok!  In my opinion... there where many steps that could be made just better with a litte bit more gaming expierence from other point and clicks...  So all in all: OK and Walk Thru Walls Studios GO4IT! 4,99€ is it not quite worth it... but I am looking for a sequel with a little bit better gaming experience ;)  Recommendation: 'Meh' would be the real answer... but since I have to choose one and 'No' wouldn't be quite fair: Yes.
