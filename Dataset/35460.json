            "review_text": "The Ball is a beautiful 3D environmental physics puzzler. That means: fiddle with stuff until you solve a puzzle. Then walk a ways, and get a new puzzle. Repeat. Think 'Portal', but without the sense of humor.  You've got a giant metal ball and a magnetic gun at your disposal, that only controls the ball. With this one mechanic, you face a series of increasingly-complicated obstacles. Also: undead zombies and mummies.  The Ball is creative and well-made, but I grew tired of the repetitive gameplay more quickly than I expected to.   However, if you see The Ball on sale, the fun of plowing over zombies with a giant metal ball is defintely worth the price of admission. You throw the ball, kill a few, then kill a few more on the rebound. It's a unique form of combat, and always good for a laugh.",

It keeps adding new mechanics throughout pretty much the entire experience, so you don't have too many instances of a copy and paste puzzle or scenario. However, the rough edges can at times be VERY annoying, especially in regards to sections where the player needs to run through an area dodging and enemy with a fast and hard to dodge insta-kill attack. This enemy cannot be killed except by activating something which can only be reached by moving through the attack range. These sections don't really have any set in stone way to get past them, save pray you manage to get lucky after a lot of trying over and over again. This is but one little nitpick in an otherwise enjoyable cheap puzzle game. If you've got the spare change and feel like spending a few hours on an okay puzzle game, it's worth giving a try.",

Puzzles are main thing in this game, makes u think a lot how u going to solve things and advance further in game.There is a gun as only weapon i found so far in game and its not meant for shooting.U controll The Ball with it.Yeah , simmilar with Portal.U can fight enemies with The Ball too.

            "review_text": "The Ball with some pretty big flaws.  First, I'll start with the good: The environment design. The vast caves and ancient mayan/aztec/central american cities are very captivating to look at and explore. There are some great vistas in the game. Similarly, the design of the enemies is pretty good. Also, the ball puzzles are, for the most part, fun, if quite easy to solve.  However, there are a lot of problems. The first thing that hits you is the wya the game is renderd. It has a sort of 'cell-shaded-but-not-really' feel to it, and it looks as if someone was toying with the saturation filter a little too much at times. But this isn't anything major, and is probably more a matter of personal taste.  One of the biggest gripes I have with this game is the level design. Yes, I just praised the environments, you would think the level design was good too, no? Unfortunately, this game suffers very badly from 'invisible wall syndrome'. Rather than design the areas you can walk around to not have areas you can cheat your way around, the devs simply slapped an invisible wall wherever you're not supposed to go. This is really jarring and annoying when I encounter it in a game, especially one that involves having to more around an object like the ball. It ggets so bad that at one point, thanks to a physics glitch, I had trapped myself floating in mid air, standing on top of an invisible wall, and was unable to get back into the level because it was there.  Also, on the subject on exploring the nvironment. There comes times when you try to explore the area to find more 'secrets', but find yourself being forced onto the next area because you solved a puzzle or boss fight too quickly, which prevents you from finding the secrets. This is very annoying.  There are also some 'boss' fights which range from incredibly easy to beat to downright impossible without dying many times first. You shouldn't have to rely on the game saving your progress on dying to get past bosses.  I would also like to touch on the story. It starts with you trapped down a hole. Fair enough, an archaeologist is bound to have that happen to them once or twice. But then it appears they have no rope to send down the hole. And apparently they need a crane to lift you out. None of this makes sense, the hole isn't really that deep, and pretty early on in the game, the player mysteriously produces some rope with which to tie the ball to things.  So in short, The Ball is a fairly mediocre puzzle game, which if you're just a new and casual player, you may enjoy, but if you've played games for a while, you will very easily spot the flaws in it.",
