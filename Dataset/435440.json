            "review_text": "Starcraft 2 altered asset flip. Much like 'Heroes and Titans: Online' was a blatant asset theft of Blizzards 'World of Warcraft' assets.  A chinese 'developer' steals from 'World of Warcraft' and now a russian one steals from 'Starcraft 2'. Blizzard is way too big for pulling stunts like that this game will be taken down in a matter of weeks. Just like Heroes and Titans: Online.  Aside from that, it's just another Clash of Clans copy/paste game. Mobile garbage in a nutshell.  If you in any way support the game or the developer or call yourself the developer of this game, you should be meeting the same end as Ramsay Bolton. In the caring embrace of his most beloved pets.  Edit #1: Quick reminder: It's common practice to reward players with ingame goods if they leave any positive review or critic on games like that. That's why there are positive reviews in the first place. Or just shills from the developer.",
