    "description": "Based on a true story, Western Press is the most historically accurate frontier dueling game available for PC and Mac. Probably. Up to 16 players (or bots) compete in a tournament of 1v1 sprints to press a random string of ten buttons the fastest.",

            "review_text": "Western Press is Bandit-1’s first ever game on Steam while it is publisher Surprise Attack’s tenth. This time around they’ve delivered one of the most ingenious games that I have played this year in a gun toting wild west game that will be all over in a matter of seconds. The concept isn’t new it’s the delivery that is. Players – and you can play as a single player against a competitive AI – aim to beat a row of controller presses as quickly as possible. It’s a wild west shoot out as the quickest to ‘draw’ is the winner just as it was back in the days of the wild west partner.  There’s not a whole lot to the game – the above is what you do – but the presentation makes the game addictive. The presentation with the setting is what makes the game. If you’ve ever wanted to know what it’s like to virtually have a quick draw at high noon then this is your opportunity. The game quickly becomes addictive – even playing against the AI – and you will find yourself playing round after round given that they are so short (less than five seconds and highly likely under three when or if you become proficient enough at the game). I appreciated the art work and the overall narration. I thought that they were terrific additions to the game and key components in what makes the game addictive. The characters have great senses of humor.  The game is newbie friendly but as great games are it is insanely difficult to master. I have yet to complete the skills challenges (the player Vs AI part of the game) because it just gets too darn quick for my reflexes which I thought were fine. I get to the 2.5 second level and that’s about the best that I can muster. I’d really love to see gameplay videos of the very best players. I think it would be insane. The way that the game has been designed leaves it very open for tournaments – which is, in fact, a primary multiplayer component of the game.  I have yet to play using keyboard controls but I’ve seen reports that they need to be tweaked a little bit. I believe that the game was clearly made to be played with a controller as those controls are fantastic. This might impact your play if you don’t have any controllers.  The game has been Steamified with trading cards and achievements. There is cross-platform support for the game which should enrich the multiplayer experience.  I loved my time with Western Press and look forward to arranging a local multiplayer tournament for the game soon.",

It’s fun, exciting, tense, and has a ton of indie charm. For a good time that won’t cost a lot, it’s definitely worth checking out.",

            "review_text": "Could have been a pretty fun game, I like the core concepts, but the font they chose to use is abysmal. I get that they were going for a pixel look, but in a game which is about split-second reaction it is incredibly frustrating to be unable to tell an R from an A. Also, having the letters appear vertically just makes it more difficult to read as well. These aren't 'fun' challenges, they're irritating handicaps.",

Having only a split second to input a letter but needing to pause to figure out if that ambigious looking letter is a 'D' or an 'O', if that 'A' is actually an 'R' or that 'X' a 'K' ruins the experience for keyboard users.
