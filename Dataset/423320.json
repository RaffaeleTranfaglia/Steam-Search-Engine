            "review_text": "Bought it due to my love of the show Merlin, and did not even realise it was a text RPG at first. Tried it out regardless, and I definitely do not regret these past 3 hours.   It's very immersive if you do read it through, and definitely worth a second, or third, or fourth playthrough, to see what would happen if you were a pious madman, or a greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, or a humble ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ trying to avoid the throne.   All the choices you make will affect the things that happen to you, how people will respond to your actions, and so on. Sometimes, if you think you're making the wrong choice for the wrong reasons, you end up making the right choice for the wrong reasons... And sometimes it's the wrong choice for the right reasons that ends up being the reason your potential ally is now your enemy!  Great, short game, worth the money. Live through Arthur's fight for the Kingdom.   ",

            "review_text": "Choices aren't really choices. There are multiple options which lead to the same ending. After the 1st playthrough this became quite apparent. Of course there are some events that matter, but for others you could pick 3/4 options with the same results... Mystifying... I understand the game is 2.99 but cmon. If you're too lazy to program different results for different choices, just make it 2 choices Aor B. Not ABC with the same result and choice D as something different... Makes the game to appear to have more depth than it actually possesses.",

The story is brand new but there is bit here and there that still relate to the old myth. However, it do feel like another game cause it is not the well know story, it kind of feel like those other person who have the same name but doing different thing, and the personality of each character is also different than how you expected.   I'm personality a bigger fan of queen Guinevere, then Arthur acturally, so that was a down side for me, cause there are no sing of Guinevere in the story at all.  But over all, it is a great game like the rest of the 'Choice of Game' games, totally worth buying, it is just fun reading it as well. I do wish there is more of it, cause the story feel kind of left off in the middle, without fully explane or express itself.",
