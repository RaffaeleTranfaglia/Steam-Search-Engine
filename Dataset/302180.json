            "review_text": "Great game, But quite annoying to set up on WIndows 7 - Requires right-clicking the Game.exe and adjusting combatibility mode to Windows XP. For anyone interested in point-and-click adventure games I do recommend getting it though, especially because it is quite cheap with a coupon.   I played this game back in 2006 I think and am very happy to see it on Steam since I lost my old copy of the game. I found the puzzles actually very fun and the entire game is put together well with 360 degree views of certain areas in a good amount of detail, especially for a game from 2005. There is only a couple timed puzzles, though dying in the them does nothing except cause a small cutscene which is easily skippable - also being able to save at any point in the game is useful. The inventory system is easy to use, though organising it can be a little tedious. Also, there is multiple ways of solving most things, and some puzzles aren't even required to do until later in the game - (You might even solve a puzzle without knowing what it's for until later!)   Overall, A very good point-and-click puzzle-adventure game.  For anyone who can't solve puzzles and requires a walkthough there is a couple on the internet, and I have written my own in the Steam 'Guides' page if you are interested, it also explains how to set up the game on Windows 7, and it might also work for 8. (But don't hold me against it if it doesn't...)",

            "review_text": "I came into this game not expecting much to be honest but I actually found this game's story to be somewhat interesting. It's a point and click. For the first 1h and 30min I was in a space pod/capsule figuring stuff out until I landed on the moon and there are weird things there but I don't want to spoil anything. The game keeps on having puzzles and you need to figure out what goes with what. They have made it clear nothing in this game is straightforward. It is important to have patience and to have a casual outlook on how it is. If you lack patience you won't really get far and you will be frustrated. I like the light tone narrative and the mini art cutscenes of images.   8.2/10. Buy it on a sale or something if it's dirt cheap.",
