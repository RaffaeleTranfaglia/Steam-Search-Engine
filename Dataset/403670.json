            "review_text": "Lumber Island - That Special Place is a great short horror game created by one person! (2-3 hours) This hidden gem is quite a treat for horror fans. The level design and atmosphere is amazing and the game mechanic feels like Amnesia or Penumbra. The HUD is pretty much empty to get the best immersion! You can only walk around and interact or move object around with your cursor.  The puzzles are pretty logical imo. I didn't stuck at any of those puzzles :) I enjoyed a lot to explore around and move all the objects around to find stuff and solving the puzzles.  I normally lag like hell with max settings on any new game with good visuals but this is one must be very compatible with my old pc. (Geforce GTS 450)  This game will be even more awesome when it gets VR support! A must buy for people who enjoyed Amnesia or Penumbra =)",

            "review_text": "NOTE: This review focuses on my personal views on the CONS of the game.  I must say this game surprised me a bit, straight from the beginning. The graphics are beautiful and the story is interesting and I do recommend it, but I will discuss the two main things that bothered me the most.  You, as the player start the game with no hints as to what your goal but as you start exploring, the story begins to unfold and you come accross an intimidating enemy whom at this point - you know nothing about. This can either be taken as a pro or con, but as for me, I would have preferred a little introduction to the game and what I needed to do. You figure out what you need to do from finding notes and interpreting the clues, the puzzles aren't too hard nor easy. Some just require a bit of thought and patience - which I prefer over overly difficult puzzles.  Although I said the story is interesting, it needs a little more work, just to fine tune it. It gets a bit confusing, with flashbacks and no narration to give the player a clear understanding of what is going on and how each memory ties in with the main storyline. It seems as if it was the devs idea to encourage individual players interpretation which for me, wasn't done effectivly.   All in all, this is a great game for just $5. Despite discussing more of the negative aspects of the game, it has a stand-out storyline, eerie setting and beautiful graphics for an indie horror. It's a short game, maybe an hour to an hour and a half playtime but it is worth it!",

            "review_text": "It looks good and it shows what can be done on an indie budget with Unity, Adventure Creator, and some skill. But it is a pretty bad game. It makes no sense. You wander around in the dark with some murderer out to get you. If he sees you, you're dead. You can't hide; he'll get you. And he must have night-vision goggles. He can see you before you ever see him coming. And the only way to stop him is to find a couple of boots and give them to him??? WTF? How is anybody supposed to figure that out? Poor game design. Poor puzzle design. Great atmosphere. I'm sorry I wasted money on it though. Another game for the trash bin. Put the 3-5 bucks toward a decent horror game like Outlast or SOMA.",
