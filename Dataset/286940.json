Turkish players have flooded the servers with spam in chat and no one wants to CW with them because they have one of the worst reputation(hacks). But seriously everyone can get cheats in this game no matter the country. The comunity is getting toxier and everyone doubts of everyone. I can deal with the low SP in victories and the iron sight/ Sg's but the unfairness of hacks and macros... Still, I created a new account to play on steam but now I know once again why I uninstalled this game about 2 years ago.  I used to have so much fun with this, it's kinda sad for me.",

            "review_text": "I'm very conflicted.   Pros: it's kind of like 'CoD for poor people'. Where I think this game has an advantage over CoD is there's no 'stupid deaths' so to speak. EI you're not gonna get killed by some stupid bout of luck like a claymore or a killstreak. It's pretty bare bones.  Cons: really made me question if I wanted to recommend this game, but it's got the stupid typical korean p2w crap attached to it. The VIP is just...idk how to word it without just saying it's the stupidest ****. VIP gives you camos which increase your weapon damage and reduce recoil by 5%. But that's not all! it also allows you to spawn instantly...like really? Then this games got a super low population and they're gonna have this VIP crap in their game...their game may have been dying prior to this, but sure as hell adding the VIP crap isn't gonna make people wanna stay it's gonna kill your game that much faster. Two other lesser cons is there's a big lack of customization, not a lot of weapon choices, and I was really hoping for the cool cat gun I saw on youtube. Then lastly which also is a bit of a fun killer...some weapons are way over tuned. I've been using the...m16 I believe. 1 burst kills most I think that's a little redic.   random tip: play on the EU. US is completely dead.  Edit: at the moment it would seem the EU servers either got merged with the US or just got shut down. Any time I attempt login via EU it says the game isn't available in my region. I thought maybe a region lock was placed, but wouldn't let me on even with a VPN.",

(The game is not suitable for everyone, shorten costumer range)   &gt; One shot headshot kill no matter what bullet and distance. Guns with high RPM have the most advantage. Eh, SMG anyone? And accurate and low recoil guns too, 'FAMAS anyone?', make sense with rifle rounds but pistol and SMG rounds on a helmet from afar.   &gt; Maybe is a good idea to make all enemy model the same, models depending on the maps. This will nullify 'You use this model so you look slimer noob'. Or 'I can hit your head easily cause of your blonde wigs'  &gt; Anyone with macro (Rapid Click Per Second) have more accuracy and recoil recovery than normal burst or full auto fire players sadly. Need to fix this or everyone gana use macro mouse and play this exploit.   &gt; Takes grinding to earn SP without VIP.",

Originally as Soldier Front 2, this game doesn't have much to really live up to besides being somewhat of a Call of Duty clone. It's an okay game but it can definitely be better but if these developers want to actually want to be relevant, they need to start changing up and bring in new features instead of using the same old feature over and over again. A lot of these F2P P2W FPS games are dying but it's good though, we got better games like Overwatch and Rainbow Six Siege.",

There's really no place to stop by and reload before going back into battle. - No ups/downs for secondary weapons and such. Only primary weapons. - No shotguns or miniguns?  Overall I think S.K.I.L.L has the potention to become one of the best FPS Shooter games. Perhaps as good as CS:GO as you don't have to pay as much to get good guns - never mind the huge price to buy the game itself. Graphics could be improved but it's quite realistic (in a virtual way). I love how there're different zooms for different guns and they've added just about everything but shotguns and miniguns. It would be awesome if you could hit players with guns too for those who don't have time to press f, especially with a slow tomahawk. Very good for a free game.  I definitely recommend this to those who wish to have a fair chance and love multiplayer and shooter games. Also those who love sniping others from afar and spraying bullets into people from behind.

Firstly, the community is ♥♥♥♥. If you are good, you are a cheat. If you wear armor you are a tank, if you use a certain gun you are a noob. If you hack, you say you are esl.  Before you read below - my KD is 1.6 so when I moan about hackers, it isn't because I am a noob.  Secondly, there are so many hackers in this game. You won't very often come across someone with an aimbot but you have so many wallhackers in the game it's unbelievable. Don't get me wrong, if you have headphones and good sound you can hear people from a mile away stomping around like an elephant. But when you're walking and someone is just sat there waiting for you (really somewhere you wouldn't normally wait) then you know whats up.   Combined with my SF Asia account I have a lot of hours on this game, it's fun and addictive in the right rooms.   People say it's a pay to win game, not really. The game is mainly about headshots, what ever HP you have or armor.. you'll still die if you are hit in the head.  Anyways, do more about hackers because you really are not doing fk all about it. Also make windowed mode go down to taskbar and not a 360x140 box.. thank you.",

Not to mention that the game has been put into the ESL ONE, what makes it much more competetive than it was intednded to be at first. This is why there is still quite a few bugs to be fixed, e.g. terrible hitbox and kill cam needs a work on. But other than that I can say the game is worth a while.",

It's extremely thrilling, also frustrating sometimes, very skill based and we think it could find its spot in competitions as well.  - Survival: Co-op mode where you have to withstand the attacks of insect-like horrifying aliens, Starship Trooper style. A nice break from the competitive game modes.  - Defence: Same story, co-op vs AI, but this time you have to defend some kind of nuclear reactor against multiple waves of aliens.  - Seizure: Capture the flag style mode.  - Escape: A team has to activate some radio stations and escape the area, while the other team tries to kill them before they manage to escape.  - Blasting: A team must place the bomb and the opponents have to stop them or defuse the bomb in time. From what we were able to see, this is one of the most played game modes, and it's actually very fun, especially if played with friends.  - Party modes: This is where the game tries to offer something truly unique, and manages to do that with some crazy and funny game modes: in Manhunt, one team of players will take the role of the aliens and try to hunt the humans, while the other team will play as the soldiers that have to kill all the aliens. There are three different types of aliens to use, including a kamikaze one which explodes after a sprint. Very fun to play. Glass is probably one of the craziest game modes we've ever seen in an FPS: players are in an arena composed of different floors entirely made of hexagonal glass pieces. You can shoot your enemies or shoot at the glass under their feet to break it and make them fall to the bottom, under which there is just death. Hilarious.

See this is a good game for noobies to learn about the FPS gaming comunity but when the bones are already picked its hard to see this as a game for Veterans in the comunity.  Now am I saying you should'nt try try the game HELL NO im just saying that there is aloot of ways for this game to improve it self yet the Game dev are not looking at the big picture.

Also, the crouch-jumpo thing is completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and they should really just keep crouch jumping to what it is instead of pressing them both at the same time with the smallest window of opportunity to actually jump a centimetre higher than usual to actually get onto something that you should just be able to normally jump onto. The hitboxes in this game are appalling. Someone can shoot about 3 metres to the left of an enemy and still hit them. The only time the hitboxes actually work is when you're using a sniper rifle, which puts people who like to use snipers at a huge disadvantage in normal game modes. It's a shame, because sniping in this game feels extremely solid and a lot of fun. It really feels rewarding when you get a good kill. If they could improve on the things I've mentioned, then I would definitely play it a lot more.",

With its simple graphics and solid mechanics, combined with a fair in-game shop and a complete clan system, the game has the right tools to offer a nice competitive scene for hardcore players and an enjoyable environment for new players as well.",

Or if there is, I didn't experience it. If on one map you encounter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t players then just pick another one. It's as simple as that.
