In this game, you are an architect hired by the Roman Empire to build cities. Each time you succeed your notoriety increases and you will get better (though harder) jobs.    Campaign",

Even tho it is just like Build-a-lot, it is less polished than those games, blend graphics, no flashy animations, different backdrops or even a way to zoom in, what is really missed, but for it's price, it's excusable.  I would recomend this game, it's a good game for it's price, very challenging, specially if you try to go for 100%  ",
