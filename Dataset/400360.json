            "review_text": "Omg. i so thought this game was more than provided in the pictures and trailer... a bit tomb raider alike but with more puzzles. but it was not..... lets start with pros: - nice graphics (for the environment)  - puzzles can take some time (which is nice)  then the cons: - very short game +- 4 hours!!!! - very easy - no variations in game play - blocky movement (cant jump on stone of 1 inch high....) - predetermined way to walk (no exploring) - voice acting - PRICE!!!!!!! - ending (kinda lame)  it is basically around 5 hours of following a line and solve puzzles (not even that much puzzles)   To make the summary whole literately the worst game i have ever bought on steam.!! dont let yourself be fooled by the pictures like i did. watch the walk trough on you tube if you want to know how it is. I think it sucks especially for this price!! my god there goes my money...  ",
