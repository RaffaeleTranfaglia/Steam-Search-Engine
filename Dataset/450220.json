            "review_text": "It's Descent. If you played Descent when you were younger, it's back, proper. The two designers for the original Descents have made a proper spiritual continuation, it looks and plays exactly as it should; you smash panels and parts off repurposed mining robots until they go fireworks, while they try to extract the meaty bit from your ships metal shell using various methods.  The controls are intuitive, the momentum physics behave as you would expect, the weapons have a solid feel to them (even the frickin laser beams) and each connecting hit gives a physics reaction and a pretty light show as reward. The sound is great, the baddies sound suitably demonically possessed, the lighting is a real treat, accurate realtime shadows (something of a rarity these days for some reason) are on full display and it all sits together in a surprisingly atmospheric package.  You still get as disorientated as the original Descents and the screen fills with carnage quickly, but that's a positive in this reviewer's book. The story is to be written by the writer of Freespace 2 and the music is from the original Descent's crew, many Parallax (original Descent) developers are in the team, making this a very exciting project.  Check out the  Kickstarter  for more info, definitely check out the excellent free teaser demo, it's nostalgia redone right.",

The ingame HUD is difficult to read during a fight but that's to be expected for such an early release.   The FEEL of this game is right, so as content gets added (bots, levels, weapons, etc.) I know it will become a great game. If you don't believe me, try for yourself its free after all!",

It feels fantastic, and it also looks fantastic, all with the 6DOF glory. Flying around feels really natural, and the default keybindings for keyboard/mouse are actually really good, though I still want to try it with a joystick as well, gotta dust it off..  The graphics are amazing, specifically the lighting, which shows off in the dark areas, but the explosions and special effects are also really good so far.  The guns and missiles are a lot of fun, some are equivalents from the original Descent games, others are completely new things, important is that they feel really good, nice and punchy.  If this is just the teaser, I'm pretty damn hyped for the full game :D",

This brings it all back!  It took a few minutes of floating around and bumping into walls to get the hang of the controls, then I was whizzing around like a pro. Of course once I could control the ship well enough to leave the first room I got hopelessly lost, it's surprisingly hard to navigate with no fixed up or down! The wide range of different robots was a highlight in the original, my particular favourite was the invisible one that would pop out of nowhere and savage you with its claws. As such, I enjoyed my one death in Overload so far, carefully sneaking along tunnels looking for bots, when I hear the rapidly approaching whir of buzzsaws behind me, and turn around just in time to see the bot pounce on me!  I've backed the kickstarter, really feels like the original game, but of course with somewhat improved graphics!",

            "review_text": "There has been many reboots or spiritual successors of many games as of late. Some successfully bring back what made those games great, and some bring new innovations to revitalise the IP. However it is seldom both.  Doom as an example, has gone from its original demon killing fast paced mayham, then a slow paced action horror game which lost all of what originally made it great. That has become clear to the developer, and is now adapting both what made the original great and bringing modern innovations capable in todays gaming.  But why am I talking about Doom, when this is not Doom? Well, Overload is a perfect example of a developer bringing back what made a game great (Descent) during the same era, and updating it with new innovations.  They have demonstrated in this demo that they are bringing back the fast paced robot destroying action, with the great 6DOF movement that made the original an instant classic, whilst still embracing the innovations in modern gaming.  This demo is a prototype build they have currently made before even being funded to actually produce the game. Yet it feels far more polished than you would expect in those circumstances, with far more enjoyment then you would expect.  I recommend having a play of this demo, and see the potential behind this tiny glimse of what this developer is capable of, and if you like what you see go back the game on kickstarter. Because if this demo can entertain you, imagine what they will produce further with that funding.  Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy this hopefully soon to be master piece.",

            "review_text": "So read about this game one day, on a forum. Having played Descent 1, 2, and 3 years ago naturally I was intrigued. So gave it a whirl. About the game:  Robots moved and behaved similarly to Descent. Perhaps even smarter. There was one robot that charged at you with saws. That was pretty cool and a bit unexpected. Weapons felt right and very close to original Descent. I stumbled upon some favorites, like the Fusion Cannon (called Thunderbolt here I believe). I'm hoping a Plasma Cannon clone appears too. It might already be in the alpha, I'm not sure. There were also some new weapons or new twists to weapons. Felt my dinner move around in my stomach as I went through the tight and cramped corridors dodging enemy fire WITH auto leveling turned off. This isn't a negative but an absolute positive. The rush to find the exit after wrecking the reactor was there too.  In fact the game felt so much like Descent that after setting the controls as how I remembered them, I felt right in home with no effort having to relearn anything (with exception of the new weapon names and what they were in original Descent). The controls felt on point with what you'd expect from Descent. If they keep it up and it only gets better from here then it's definitely a must play for old fans. It's only missing the PTMC as far as I can see.",

            "review_text": "TLDR: Awesome demo, with one or two missteps. 5-20 minutes of fun for free, I recommend.  The game is slightly disorienting but it's got some real potential. I rather enjoyed my five minutes of zero-G dogfighting, and I hope to see the game come out swinging when it releases.  The good: 1: Movement. As the game says, you can move freely in any direction you please. the experience is like flying a space helicopter with no set up or down. The game will orient you somewhat, helping to keep you in line with walls and floors, which is really helpful. In addition, all enemies will orient themselves to match you, which makes them easy to swiftly recognize and fire on. 2: Mechanics. I will admit, the system of grabbing powerups and weapons feels a little old-school, but the weapons themselves aren't bad. Though the driller wasn't particularly exciting, the flak gun was fun, and Lightning felt badass. The explosives were slightly more confusing, as I had no idea what a 'creeper' was (It seemed to be a sort of grenade, so I ended up panic-spamming it a lot) but they felt alright. 3: Presentation. This is a pre-alpha teaser, and as such it didn't have to look amazing, but looking at the enemy ships (Robots?) gave it a good sense of style, and the effects looked pretty nice. And this is only pre-alpha. If the art keeps improving, it'll look great!  The bad: 1: The reticle. It's rare to have an element of the UI affect the gameplay, but the reticle (The 'aiming crosshairs', for those who don't know) got in my way a bit. The shape was helpful is figuring out how my primary weapon's shots would land, but the lines were thick and bright enough that looking past them to see threats in the distance was rough. It's not a big deal in many of the more confined corridors, but there was at least one or two dogfights where I wanted to turn it off. In the end, it's a small, easy fix that ought to be fixed fast. 2: Weapons satisfaction. I know it might not be true that EVERY weapon in a game is satisfying to use, but a few of the weapons' sounds, effects, and function weren't super fun. Particularly thinking of the driller and the falcon missiles. Not a big deal, as there's enough other guns to find and test out (Flak is fun, guys. Find it, try it, celebrate the fourth of july.) that you'll have fun. 3: Lack of direction/instruction. This didn't affect me a WHOLE lot, but it was pretty easy to get lost in some of these levels, and though I think the tutorial map told you about the driller, there weren't a lot of tooltips for the weapons, telling you what they do and such. The starter gun, driller, and flak all function as machine gun weapons, but the lightning gun is a charge weapon reminiscent of a megabuster. The falcon, hunter, and presumably devastator are all rockets, but the creepers are grenades. They might not've been hard to use, but a little blurb about them in the menus or a more dedicated tutorial would help. Certainly, the tutorial helps you move around, but it doesn't teach you much about the weapons or the objectives. I personally had no idea what the reactor was, or how to destroy it when I tried that mode, and though I found and killed it by trial and error (And luckily found the emergency exit BEFORE I messed with the reactor) I wasn't sure if I was supposed to just blast away or do something nuanced, like shoot at the 'eye'. (PS, the answer is blast away. It's not obvious, since most weapons don't immediately rip it up, but just keep shooting. Or better yet, explosive spam.) It seems like a big problem, but again, it ought to be an easy fix.  The neutral: This game is definitely better with a gamepad. Just be ready to mess with your bindings, I personally found X/A to rotate and LT/LB to raise/lower to be a bit weird, and I honestly need to swap it.  Verdict: It's not perfect, and there's some work to be done, but trust me: It's not bad. It's just a quick free demo to show off the mechanics, and it was kinda fun. Slightly disorienting, but fun for sure. Just grab the fun guns and go to town for a few minutes. Would I recommend this if it were a full game? Maybe not. Would I say it's a great demo/teaser, and it's made me intrigued to see how the full game turns out? Hell yes. I mean, it's free, and it's like ten minutes of your time. Go for it!",
