            "review_text": "A great tool to help you reflect on yourself and answer the question 'Is my greed preventing me from succeeding in life (and Scred)?'  Also fantastic for people who like challenging but addictive and rewarding games! I've played many hours before the Steam release, and I'm sure I'll play many more. The price is an absolute steal for the hours of entertainment and pain you can get out of Quarries of Scred. 100% recommended.",

            "review_text": "Fantastic game. Great soundtrack and a challenging puzzler. Easy to play but hard to control your greed. Definitely one of the most rewarding games I've played. It's simple, balanced, fun and has a lot of replay value.",

        {
            "review_text": "This is a hard and rewarding game. It's endlessly replayable. It's especially fun to compete against friends in the Daily Quarry, which you're only allowed to attempt once per day.   Whenever you die, it's 100% your fault. You'll see some gems you want to excavate, formulate a plan on how to reach them, and if you don't mess it up you'll walk away with the treasure. I can't overstate how enjoyable it is to clear a Quarry with as many gems as you risk collecting, and managing to get out of there with a high score and your life intact.  One of my favourite indie games, highly recommended.",

The dev is also a fantastic and lovely guy who has done a lot to support his fellow indie devs, and for that I would give him eternal thumbs up. This is a must buy and the different tilesets are a great feature. Music is great too :)",
