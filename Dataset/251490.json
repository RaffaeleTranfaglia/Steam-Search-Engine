Pros:  Super gorgeous artwork Fun music Novel gameplay Wonderful story  Cons:  Controls can be a little annoying especially when trying to catch a star in a specific location Story gets revealed slowly with lots of metaphors Game kinda short  I recommend this game for anyone looking for an original experience, fun gameplay, and a great story.",

            "review_text": "The original review can be seen at   RogueReviews   [theroguereviews.com]  with gifs, video clips and captions.   TL;DR  Gravity Ghost is a beautiful tale about a girl and her pet fox journeying through the galaxy, collecting stars and terraforming planets along the way.   Pros   +beautiful art style +great music +unique gameplay +good story   Cons   - no real options menu  Gravity Ghost starts with an intro scene that looks straight out of a children's book. Colourful and vibrant, drawn with what looks like a mixture of pastel and crayons, the artstyle immediately stands out. You're greeted by a young girl and her fox companion resting on top of a planet before the fox slowly disappears into the cosmos while the girl beckons for him. You play as Iona, who realizes that a black hole has appeared in the center of her universe where she can see her friends and family back on earth.  At its core, Gravity Ghost is a tale of innocence. How children have boundless freedom without the constraints of consequences weighing on their minds. Iona was a rambunctious child, who befriended a wild fox, takes long journeys in the middle of the nights with no regard for her sister Hickory, who gave up her future to take care of the family after the tragic death of their parents. Iona throws blames to those who care for her, desperately trying to hide her pain, acting out in ways that hurt her loved ones. As you watch through the wonderfully drawn cutscenes, it conveys to you memories that all adults can relate to through their childhood. Newfound emotions and how much they can impact a child for the rest of their life. Gravity Ghost does this with such relative ease that it can make you forget that Iona is just a drawing on a screen, as well drawn as it may be.  Gameplay consists of physics based puzzle platforming where you control Iona flying through space and navigating past all different kinds of planets that affect the push and pulls of gravity while dancing back and forth like clockwork. Each level has a star piece that lets you complete the level, how you decide to grab the star piece is all up to you. This is where the game holds most of it's charm as you fly around in limbo, there are no deaths to be had here, no frustrating moments, just a zenlike experience that's as relaxing as it is soothing with it's wonderfully crafted soundtrack reminiscent of the composer's work on FTL crossed with the childlike joy of Yann Tiersen's earlier work.  As you travel through star systems, through the overview of the map the game uses it's artstyle with small markers to clue you in on levels that will progress the storyline or add to the mechanics that Iona can use to alter gravity. Iona can find spirit animals scattered throughout the galaxy and it's only with her help that they can return to their bodies and find the peace to move on. Anytime you help an animal move on to the afterlife, a cutscene is shown depicting life when Iona was still on earth with her family. These cutscenes slowly reveal the circumstances that lead to Iona becoming a ghostly spirit alone in space. Iona contemplates these unlocked memories and laments over past actions and words that she now regrets. It's the Guardian Spirits who guide her forward, each spirit being a representation of a loved one in her past life.  Iona gains the ability to terraform planets by finding different elements unlocked through solving labyrinth puzzles. Terraforming planets changes the gravitational pull depending on the element. Fiery gas planets are explosive, pushing you up and away like a volcano and hesitate to pull you in. Water planets allow you to swim within its atmosphere and have a heavy pull making it hard for you to leave it's atmosphere with no momentum. There are seven elements in total, each with it's own unique gameplay element and giving you the opportunity to use any of them as you see fit to complete a level.  Gravity Ghost is refreshing and a breath of fresh air in a medium where killing zombies reigns supreme. In Gravity Ghost, failure isn't a gameplay mechanic, giving you the liberty and freedom to take your time and play with the levels as long as you'd like. It's the signature music that really drives the experience that you are child in awe of your surroundings. Her surroundings are playful and vibrant just like her imagination, allowing you to see through her eyes as if they were your own. Iona's tale is emotional, a cry for help in the endless vastness of space but in the end she finds her place in the cosmos. I  highly recommend  Gravity Ghost to players of all ages and experience, every purchase nets you two copies for yourself and a friend so you can share and enjoy!",

            "review_text": "Gravity Ghost is a very good game, with a solid base in gravity puzzle mechanics that vary up throughout as the game changes, and a story that is incredibly touching and likely to make you cry. The game mixes that with a beautiful crayon-esq art style and one of the best and most unique sound tracks.  While Gravity Ghost isn't terribly long, it is a great game with solid mechanics, great athestics, and more then worth your time.",

            "review_text": "Gravity Ghost is a very easy going yet hard hitting 2D platformer game.  Not wanting to spoil too much, but the story deals with a girl who has become a ghost, and you follow her spirit wandering the stars. The story as a whole works very well at telling the story of family and dealing with loss.  You use the gravitational pulls [and other physics] of various types of planet to collect the spirrits of animals and return them to their bodies so they can be at peace, all the while attempting to right certain wrongs in the physical world. Combining various physics puzzles, mazes and other interactions there is a wide variety to the various levels.  Contolled by mouse / keyboard / controller, this game works well with whichever mode of control you desire.  The graphics in this game are in a 'painted' style, which works very nicely at setting the atmosphere. Similarly, the music in this game is wonderful. All together it really fits well with a spacey-spiritual feeling.  Wgile the game itself is quite short, it is nonetheless worth playing. For the story and the puzzles, both of which it excels at.

There is no downtime, and always something new to discover. When you are not discovering new gameplay, you are discovering new worlds and stories.  Graphic, audio and pacing are great. The cutscenes and story they tell are great.  The cutscene graphics can be considered low-end, but they are unique - and in the end, just not that important. Their colors and audio stay of high quality, pulling you in.  136 minutes for the full play through: Some achievements still huntable.  I can whole-heartedly recommend this game. Take the two hours off for a full and uninterrupted playthrough. It was a great experience I have not had in a long time, and the ending brought a bit of tears into my eyes.",

            "review_text": "A straightforward physics puzzler that places you at the whim of gravity and tasks you with catching stars and reuniting animals with their skeletons to reveal story cutscenes. I'm not entirely sure why the animal reuniting was the delivery method for the story, but it was a touching story. The delivery was kind of confusing but it never detracts from the game. I think I'd've liked the story better if there was an easy way to watch all the cutscenes in order.  The gameplay is what really shines though. As stated, it's a physics puzzler that has you standing on planetoids, jumping between them and orbiting them to collect stars. As the game progresses, it introduces new planet types--ice planets that you slip and slide on, gaining a little more speed/momentum when you jump off, gas planets that you bounce off of, etc.-- skills that affect your mobility, and powers that let you terraform planets. 94 levels, most of which are about two or three minutes long unless you're like me and just uncoordinated enough to mess up your run by hitting the wrong direction because you forgot to take your orientation and nearness to a planet into account.   The art style is beautiful; flat 2D, chalk or pastel type drawings that are just so pleasant to look at. The soundtrack is amazing.   All told, a great physics puzzler with a good, if oddly presented, story. Some people think it's priced a little high for how long it takes to play, I say it's well worth it. It's the kind of game you'll play and put away, and then come back to in a few months or years in between other games.",

            "review_text": "This game is fantastic.  Ok so meat and bones:  Gameplay (the bones!):     Mechanics are very easy to grasp with room for some intense complexity. The core mechanic isn't too hard to understand, good for beginners. But mastering it definitely requires some level of skill. Especially where you have some unusual orbits with your gravity sources.   No truly frustrating stuff. I know some people like a game that makes them scream in fury and pull out hair. I'm not one of those people. I especially like that the lack of frustration also applies to that mastery thing above, it influences the unique ways you can get through a puzzle faster for your enjoyment, but it doesn't make certain puzzles overly difficult. You can solve everything even if you haven't mastered the methods but you can solve stuff better, collect every single flower, break every glass sphere, etc if you have mastered things. The starstuff challenges and maybe one single puzzle gave me some trouble but nothing truly irritating and solving them was satisfying.   Upgrades are genuinely useful. All of them. I found a use for literally every single Heart upgrade I found.    Abilities are genuinely useful. While you don't use terraforming a lot, it's fun and interesting and you can play with some before you end the puzzles. It does genuinely help quite a bit for a few puzzles and is necessary for a number as well   Puzzle variety was excellent. I really didn't feel like I dealt with any sort of repetition even once. The early puzzles of each guardian's area were definitely easier but they typically introduced a new puzzle mechanic that would affect your play. None of them felt gimmicky either and they helped give each Guardian's set of levels a feel all their own.   Story, music and art (the meat!)    I can't tell you too much without spoiling and I won't do that. The story is so good though. So very very good. I was really blown away by it, it got me pretty emotional. The funny parts made me smile and laugh out loud, the sad parts made me genuinely cry (my cold dead heart is hard to stir). The voice actors were fantastic (I saw in the credits that Ashly Burch did a huge bunch of the voices and just really good work from her) and the story was offered in bits and pieces that were great for pacing, never left me truly confused and tied itself together beautifully at the end. Very well written and put together.   The art was totally adorable. I loved the bright colors and paper cut out feel to it. The designs for the spirits combined with their skeletons was amazing and the overall aesthetic was wonderful. And it really didn't feel too cartoony, the human characters and animals were consistent in their designs with general human anatomy (and animal anatomy) so it was a nice balance there.   The music was perfectly suited to this game and good on its own. I could listen to this soundtrack all day. Perfect low pressure puzzle music and the tracks for the guardians and story snippets set a perfect atmosphere   Misc (the... feathers???)    Length was good. Not super long, not super short. It's a game that I was able to finish pretty quickly but I still felt like I got a good deal of enjoyment and time out of it. It's hard to strike that time balance, esp for puzzle games which often end far too quickly.   Replayability isn't super high and that's probably the only thing bad thing I'll ever say about this game and it's not even that bad, esp for a game where a lot of its impact comes from the story. I mean I can go back and replay the puzzles but the guardians especially are very story driven. Chances are I'll probably come back to this after a number of months and enjoy the entire experience again but it's not the sort of game I'll replay every week or so like some I've had.   It's really nice to have a game without violence and war and death in the gameplay. I also enjoyed this being a failureless game where my character doesn't die in gameplay. Very nice   So yes, this game was really good. I do not have anything truly negative to say about it. :)",

The character development has kept me caring for everyone on screen and the art &amp; sound ties it together nicely. It's a healthy meal of a game totaling around 3.5 hours with more, or less, depending on your maneuvering skills.  If I were nitpicking, then I would say that level design caused me some frustration, but not much. This occured mostly on the levels where the use of the orbiting concept was required (or where you use the main tool of gravity to slingshot you into a satellite-like pattern around a planet). I want to say that the game doesn't ease you into these stages like it does for other concepts. You can solve many of these levels in many different ways, the concept of orbiting one of them, but I never really opted for it until it was required. This is the big scary of level design that is hard to overcome in the development of any game, ensuring that concepts can be grasped by ALL of your audience in a way that doesn't overly frustrates them (or frustrating them to the point where they close the game).  Edit: I also nearly forgot to mention, PLEASE add button rebinding as I know that a lack of this ability can alienate a good chunk of gamers.  However, that's just me nitpicking, the concept was executed really well and it's an overall great game to give 2015 a good start!",

One of the most relaxing games out there, but don't for a second get the misbelief that its boring.'   The story is lived out in reverse. As you are collecting the animal spirits and terraforming planets you will relive the backstory about the little girl and her animal friends. For this kind of game it's a really good way of telling the story, because the intresting plot does not lie in what happens next, but what happened earlier, before you wake up as a ghost. You will also meet some guardian animals thatr really stand out. The game deliver it's message while still managing to keep the humour.  There is basically not an options menu. There's resolution and subtitle settings and that's it. I'm not sure it needs a more detailed graphical menu because of the simple yet good looking artstyle, although it would be nice with some sound sliders. Any computer should be able to run this with no problem.  Gameplay wise there's not much to talk about. You use gravity as a tool to gain flowers to extend your hair (yes you read correctly) and collect stars aswell as animal spirits and planet parts. The atmosphere is very calm and serene and you can't die (obviously because you're already a ghost...), which makes the game very relaxing. It is the perfect game if you had a rough day and don't have the energy to play anything complicated.  I really reccomend that you give this game a try and also, if you like the game you can spread the love because you get a gift copy to give to a friend for free when you purchase the game.",
