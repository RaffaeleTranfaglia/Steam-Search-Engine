            "review_text": "This is one hell of a 30 minute ride.  It's WELL WORTH the price to sit back and watch your friends scream.  IDK how many times I yelled, 'F-You dude!' and 'This isn't right!'  It felt like a living hell.  You WILL laugh, that's a given. Maybe even cry.  There aren't any video options but it's silky smooth on my 980. Has a good resolution and uses the Unreal engine.  The sound is really loud so be careful.  You also walk (Onward/Art of Fight). NO TELEPORTING. I love that. So man-up and walk it off. Put first timers on here, who cares. Just catch them when they fall over. (walking is slow so it's not so bad)  I thought I could play it seated, NOPE, it's a standing experience.  UPDATE: Installed the game onto my SSD hard drive. The Steam UI flickering went away.  PLEASE DO NOT put Grandma into this game. lol",

I would not want to go through a real haunted house created by this developer, but in VR I had the guts to make it through. It was pretty thrilling. Worth the current $9 price of admission for this experience in my opinion.   Well done! Keep em coming!",

I had my sights set on a scary grand adventure, but it was just a very short amusement park ride of repitition.   poorly done jump scares over and over. the same one of ghost miners flashing on the screen repeatedly. also no story - but in a 20 or 30 minute game who needs it? i guess more people like it than dont, but im not one of them. Still out there searching for the grand scary adventure vr game...",

I had no dizziness, only a bit of a small balance losses, when body reacted to turns and sudden stops heh. But in this game, I'd say it added to the experience, not substracted from it.  The shooting part was ok, bu more guns would be cool. The one we have certainly is not as fun to use as any from Serious Sam VR, but it was still way better with it, than if we wouldn't have it at all.  Overal, one of the few games I enjoyed in VR I think, so it's highly recommended. No replay value I'm afraid :) Get Serious Sam VR for that!",

Bottem line, check it out if you like to be scared and shoot things in a simple, fun arcade shooter. :)",

            "review_text": "I just bought a Vive and hooked it up today. Based upon online review, I bought Ghost Town Mine Ride (GTMR) as one of my first 'experiences.' And boy, was it! After trying out Google Earth, The Lab, and The Blue, and being impressed, I thought I would give Ghost Town Mine Ride a quick look. 30 minutes later I put away the Vive and unplugged the Lightboxes with sweaty hands and a rapid beating heart. And a huge grin on my face!  Before getting into the game itself, I will say that I ran into a lot of problems trying to run GTMR. I kept getting a red 'screen' in my Vive or, more often, when the game started I would get sound for a second or two and then no more audio. I didn't have any issues like this with the other beforementioned experiences, so I'm not sure what the problem was. Finally, after many reboots, audio setting changes (at random), etc., the game worked! I have no idea how I 'fixed' it...  I don't want to spoil any of the fun, but the experience starts out relatively slowly, and is reminiscent of an amusement park 'lost mine' ride. You are in a mine car as it rolls along, can shoot bottles, bat silhoettes, etc. Pretty tame. Then the car derails and you proceed the rest of the game on foot. That's when it gets really exciting!   I won't go into any more regarding the gameplay, except to say that you can go as slowly or as quickly as you want. I went rather slow. The game mechanics are very natural and intuitive -- flashlight in left hand, six-shooter in the right. The game's graphics and sound effects are great. The experience is scary, but I didn't find it so scary that I wouldn't let my 11 year old son try it out.  My only criticisms are that, 3 or 4 times during the experience, I briefly saw a 'This is Real' screen in the Vive. I see in the game's description that the developer is aware of the issue and is working on it. Additonally, a few parts of the game were 'jerky,' but maybe there's an issue with my PC? I don't have enough Vive experience to really say if the game is at fault or if my PC needs upgraded. (I suspect the latter, honestly.) For reference my machine has an i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz, 16GB RAM, and a Radeon RX 480 GPU.  A couple more points... I didn't even realize that this was a 'game' until I finished it and read some of the reviews of it here on Steam. I never 'died' once... Maybe that is because I was going so slowly, shooting everything that moved? Additionally, I'm not sure what the replay value of the game is, but, honestly, it was worth the $10 or so just to play it once. That's how much I loved it.  I am now on the hunt to see if the developer has any other 'experiences' available or planned.       ",
