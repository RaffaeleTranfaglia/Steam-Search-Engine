            "review_text": "Don't believe all the negative hype about this game. While the game does increase in difficulty rather sharply (What Paradox Interactive game doesn't...?), It's a solid trade sim. The diplomacy system is well fleshed out and the tactics one must employ to slow the devlopment of an opponents growth are fresh and varied. I don't know why everyone complains of save corruption or freezing... In 10 hours of play, I haven't experienced the slightest graphics issue. However, I can see the ship battles dropping Framerate for lesser computers.  All in all, not a bad game.   8/10",
