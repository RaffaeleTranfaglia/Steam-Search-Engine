            "review_text": "Sparkle 3 is a nice casual game where you control a creature swimming in a kind of primordial soup. Your goal is to consume nutrients scattered around, slowly growing from a tiny creature into a huge (relatively speaking, of course) behemoth. You have full control over your creature’s evolution (which is largely similar to RPGs’ level-up system), and unlike in Sparkle 2, you don’t have to worry about eating particular elements if you want to evolve in a certain way.  To spice up gameplay, you regularly receive tasks from the scientist who created you, and completing all tasks on the level allows you to move to the next one. Some tasks make the game a bit action-y, but it remains fairly easy overall, and most of gameplay consists of casual exploration of your environment. (One particular kind of challenge – Spikey Rivers can be quite hard, but it can be bypassed effortlessly if you evolve in a certain way.)  If you are looking for a relaxing game with occasional bits of action, Sparkle 3 has my full recommendation!",

In lvl 3 you'll have to pass tunnels, while you constantly drift towards spikes.  The walls (which you cannot clearly see) will push you back. You CAN do it, but it is definitely not fun.

In previous version you would just wonder around the magnificent world and eat everything you want, that's casual. In sparkle 3 Genesis, there are quests you need to complete, however you need to do it perfectly, i mean, if you fail somewhere have to start all over again, so that's not really casual that's more like a hardcore.  Now as i've cleared the game, i must say that in this game you can get the experience you can't get anywhere else, the atmosphere in which you will live is amazing. This game is amazing.",

            "review_text": "Control became more smooth and handy comparing to Sparkle 2 Evo game. Gameplay became more variable (added quests, leveling branches). Element radar became more convenient. Different music on each level. It's a pity though that now you can't swim up and down on levels freely, but only in special places with up/down-streams which cause some amount of backtracking.  Given more depth and layers graphics also looks better than in Sparkle 2 Evo, nevertheless, still requires substantial improvement. Graphic effects too vivid/bright, it's good that you can disable them from options menu to make colors less acid. But still, if picture was less saturated, more varied by saturation with a dash of harmonious or complementary colors, it may have been more pleasant to look at. For now it almost complete monochrome at max saturation (and there are many 'bloom' areas even when this option disabled), it looks rather like overexposed photo (or radiograph) with lost highlight/midtone details than impressive special effect.  Additional drawback that quests with tunnels are very frustrating. They are too hard for casual relaxation gaming. You need to restart them from the beginning again and again and again after every small wrong move. There is no way to skip them unfortunately.  Nevertheless, it is very interesting to watch over progress of your 'pet'. I would like more variations of 'pets', depending on the combination of elements and growth stages. It's a best part of the game.  Despite of shortcomings, it's a nice game for its genre and price. It could have been nicer if given even more smooth flow and better graphic and without needlessly hardcore quests.",

            "review_text": "PROS: -Gameplay is very smooth in general. -'Evolution' is easy to control and very intuitive. -Art style carrying over from previous game is this series signature element. -The idea of replacing having to eat all of one colour with having to complete quests is a good idea in itself as it makes the game less repetetive.  CONS: -Can't tell if it's about creationism, I don't appreciate having someone else faith thrown at me while playing a game. I mean sure if it's meant to be a philosophical game, but this is a game about a non descript aquatic animal eating other more descript aquatic animals. I mean maybe I'm just being paranoid and it's actually about a mad scientist turned ecologist, which is a pretty entertaining idea honestly.  -Obvious lack of knowledge of and/or lack of willingness to depect evolution and animal diets realistically. 'Blue = omnivore' .... yah.... I mean I get it's all simplified for gameplay mechanics, but it's not good to perpetuate myths and falsities about evolution (evolution is a multi generational process, it does not involve animals changing shape before your eyes). And combined with my preivous note about annoying religious overtones, this only serves to make me a tad uncomfortable and disappointed in the developers actions. Even if it's all a big coincidence it feels like it's spreading myths and that doesn't sit well.  -General art style is very nice, but I'm not a fan of the new player animals designs. In Sparkle 2 they weren't based on a real animal either, but these look like something from the Rayman universe with their segments magically held together without connecting.  -Quests are a good idea in general, but they remove much of the freeform element which is largely what made Sparkle 2 unique. Have you ever had that moment (looking at you Lego games) where you can't die but a level is just that tiny bit too difficult to deal with at the moment? So you're just endlessy trying again and again? Some of the quests really begin to feel like that and it spoils the otherwise relaxing atmosphere of the game.  Overall I give Sparkle 3 a 6/10, a decent game and worth trying out especially for the price.",

            "review_text": "A beautiful game, with well-designed UI and a 30-second learning curve. Much thought went into the ambience, the music, the tone and presentation. This game is polished in a way that few games in its class are, the rough corners sanded down to create a truly pleasant experience second only to Osmos, IMHO. So it was a surprise and annoyance to find that the level of care and creativity that went into making the game didn't map over to the pacing of the game. The first two sections of the first level are excellent, everything I could ask for in a casual game like this. Then the third section, the 'Spikey Rivers', jumps several orders in difficulty. You must navigate a slim river, without touching the sides, as it goes through a dozen hair-pin turns, another dozen tricky rapids, and ever-changing water currents coming out of nowhere, and if you touch the sides once you get sent back to the start of the river. After the 20th try, I shut the game down and looked online to see: is it just me, or did the game really jump from something kids can play to something experienced hardcore gamers are abandoning after unsuccessfully navigating the Spikey Rivers? As it turns out, it wasn't just me. Every page of reviews I looked at, from many diverse sources, was full of posts filled with words like 'frustrated' and 'ragequit', and people resignedly abandoning the game because you cannot proceed further until you finish the Spikey Rivers quest. The pacing in this game - in the 3 parts of the first level that are all most people ever see - is analogous to being taught to play checkers, then to play Osmos, then being told you can go no further unless you master Russian Roullette. If you think I am exaggerating, look up any other review... the only ones saying they didn't stop playing after the frustration of the Spikey Rivers either say they'll try again later, or say they won't play again until the makers fix The Problem. But aside from giving players the ability to treat some quests as optional, I don't see how they can fix it. The game is beautifully and consciously designed, every part fits the rest perfectly. Except for the part where any fun you were having falls down the oubliette never to be seen again. Loads of promise, a few fun levels, and then... that.",

            "review_text": "DESCRIPTION: In this game you go around eating nutrients to grow bigger and take on enemies, do quests, and explore different 'worlds' (levels).   This game is easily said as...interesting. It seems to offer a decent of content, I see a lot of levels (just by looking at least). I have beaten the third world (it has a HUGE spike in difficulty!) but with enough determination I got through it. You can go about it with the different skills (it all depends on how YOU play). But alas, the game doesn't seem to offer more than eating, growing, and getting stronger. I do recommend this though, especially on sale! I don't regret it at all, and I do see myself playing it more. I don't review games often, but I saw this game as reiew worthy (especially after seeing Mixed reviews). Everyone saying that the game is too hard on the third world just hasn't given it enough effort or just don't have a good enough grasp on the controls.   PROS: *Graphics are pretty nice, and are pleasant to look at. *The soundtrack isn't bad, so yay to that. *Variety with how you level up is nice.    you have three paths and each alter your appearance based on wich you level up most.     CONS: *Lack of activities...aside from doing what you do, there's not much else. NEUTRALITIES: *Full controller support except for one button, and it's kinda annoying for those who use controllers. *The difficulty spike on level 3; I personally had llittle trouble, but it seems a lot of people did.  I give it a 7/10.  NOTE: I played using an Xbox controller (I find this game more suited with the controller than keyboard and mouse, but that's just my opinion).   SIDE NOTE: Everything can be accessed by the controller except for the level up menu (which is tedious early game where levels are far more common, but I dealt with it).  TIP:    If you want an easy way to defeat the jellyfish, use the ability that sucks in all the nutrients; just go from behind and they're insta-dead     FINAL THOUGHTS: This game is totally worth checking out (especially with sales!). I don't see the hate, I got a good amount of time in, and I plan on more time in the future, so I might have an update (soon...?).  If you fully read my review then thank you :) I hope you get enjoyment out of this like I did!",
