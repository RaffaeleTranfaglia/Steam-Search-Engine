            "review_text": "Saturday Morning RPG is a love letter to 80s nostalgia while at the same time playing homage to the timed-hits style battle system that has shown up before in RPGs. While I wasn't an 80s kid so I was never the biggest G.I. Joe or Transformer fan, I do know a lot about the pop culture of the time and I'm a huge fan of films from the decade.The real draw here was the game's battle system to me. I'm a huge Super Mario RPG fan, and this game draws inspiration from the series that follow it up: Paper Mario. It's also been used in Costume Quest (which the game is more similar to in design), and will even be in the upcoming South Park: The Stick of Truth. So as a fan of the genre, I felt it was nesscary to toss down the cash on it.   And I enjoyed it. The game isn't the best RPG I've ever played (of all time...ever), but it's the writing, humor, and references that made me want to keep playing. Now, I've heard people saying this is a short game. Well, not really. You aren't going to beat this game quickly unless you skip all the side-quests and head straight from point A to point B. I don't suggest this. You'll miss out on a lot of a fun events, like when you find a Mogwai-esque creature and have the choice to feed it and get it wet before giving it back to Phoebe Cates herself. There IS a point around the third episode where the battles started to feel repetitive, but that soon went away as I found myself smashing Transformers with a freakin' axe. Not everyone is going to like it, but there are enough options in battle to keep situations fresh if need be. Better healing options (I didn't find a single GREAT healing item in my run) and more PCs (or a Paper Mario-esque helper) would have spiced up the battles, but if you're a fan of this type of battle system then you'll enjoy it.    You'll spend almost 5 hours with the first four episodes of Saturday Morning RPG. Another five more if you go back for achievements or try a hand at the other game modes. And for $7, it's in a good price range where a blind buy isn't risky if you're a fan of the genre and have just a little knowledge of the 80s. It's not the best RPG of all time, but it's a great indie effort and I'm always happy to see more of these.   (7/10)   Recommended If You Like:   Paper Mario  Costume Quest  80s movies, cartoon, and general pop culture",

Saturday Moring RPG is the ideal RG for people who are classic gamers as well as classic cartoon lovers from the 1980's to 1990's. The game features well over 100 pop culture items, enemies, comments, even the famous enemy one liners we all know and love since comic books.  Such things that are featured are as follows...  Basket ball = Labeled as (This ball is on fire), which is a reference to the arcade game called NBA JAM Marty = A character reference to the movie 'Back To The Future' Hover Board = A reference to the movie 'Back To The Future II'  and many more that I will let you find out on your own.  The RPG Game is almost played like Super Mario RPG for SNES, and also a cross from Undertale. Many of the RPG concepts are in this game, so many RPG fans will get a kick out of this RPG.",

Look no further as this will blow your ♥♥♥♥ing socks off.   ♥♥♥♥ anyone that has ever wrote a bad review about this game because they literally have no sense at all and really need to go and I don't know, go jump off a cliff or something (despite negative reviews helping developers improve the game I just haven't found anything wrong with it yet and if I do, I will continue to update this review). This game is truely amazing. Despite me originally only wanting to buy the game for the awesome cards and badges it has, I was always interested in what it could be like to play such a random looking game. I will never regret my decision and as soon as the game went on sale, I jumped right on it!   Now I know the truth. Saving £2 (through waiting for the game to go on sale) or whatever was really nothing, you, yes you who is reading this, should buy this game, right now! I love it.  Within the first day I bought it, I spent 4 hours that night playing it. All the nostalgic references really tie into this game better than any game I have seen to this day. All the little jokes in the game and the sarcastic expressions have not failed to make me smile.   To describe the game is very difficult and as someone who is 'new' to 'gaming' it is quite a task. It is very much an RPG where there is turn-based fighting implemented within the game aswell as many little 'sweets' that just make the game. Mini-games and side missions are everywhere and turn the 3-4 hour long story gameplay into something a lot more.   The game play in itself is like nothing I have experienced before and as someone who usually avoids RPGs, this is by far one of my favourite games, without a doubt. You can play with a keyboard or pretty much any console controller with full compatibility (even though I have destroyed the palm of my right hand through one of the many mini-games by violently moving the joystick on my Xbox 360 controller but hey, it's worth it).  After having bought it for myself, I have bought it and recommended it to all my friends as I truly believe the good guys at Mighty Rabbit Studios deserve every single penny they get, as they continue to update the game. There are currently 4 episodes but soon to be 5 which was exciting to see developers of the game continuing to love their 'baby', as they put it. So even when you think it's all over, there is even more!  Overall, I would say that is an amazing game, with amazing developers and your money would be very well spent buying this game and then later recommending it to others who may be unsure about the game aswell as your friends and even family! Buy it and enjoy hours of endless fun!",

            "review_text": "As the title implies, the game makes many pop-culture references from the 80s, that anyone born after 1990 would most likely miss. The best feature of this game in my opinion is that it is divided into episodes. Each episode has a self-contained story arc, and allows you to replay sections of the game you enjoy, whiel ignoring ones you don't. I would like to see a similar mechanic in more mainstream games.   The gameplay itself is very simple, and involves powering up, and mashing buttons. However, some attacks have amusing animations, such as the BB gun(you'll shoot your eye out, lol). Also, there is only one playable character, Marty.   All in all, This game is worth the six bucks just for the humor. For those looking for a hard-core rpg, probably not.",

The third thing I noticed was that this game was written by an autistic 5 year old and that the references are completely inane and boring. Great, the main character is named after Marty McFly. Original. Oh, The Wizard showed up! He said 'so bad' like the Power Glove scene! I grew up in the 80s and corporations aren't 'ruining our childhood' by releasing remakes, you people are doing it by not ever shutting the ♥♥♥♥ up about Back to the Future and the NES. Reference something fresh for once!  Fourth thing I noticed is how dreadfully ugly everything but the pixel art (which is only for characters) is. Everything else looks like a rudimentary polygon game from 1984.  Nah, I think I hate this game.",

I was somewhat disappointed. The 80's references are jumbled and make no sense (why would the Cobra analog exist in a He-Man inspired locale?) Many of the weapons are just plain useless and you basically have to 'power up' all the time to be effective in overly simplistic combat. The game world itself is overly simplistic and basically just involves wandering around from fight to fight until a boss battle. ...And the soundtrack isn't very good and only vaguely reminiscent of Vince DiCola's other work. Did I mention that the transforming sound effect from Transformers is literally somebody making 'whoosh whoosh whoosh' sounds with their mouth into a microphone? Perhaps I've been spoiled by the quality of other indie games I've played, but this one doesn't live up to the hype.",

            "review_text": "Saturday Morning RPG is a very unique rpg influenced by 80's culture and Saturday morning cartoons. For a gamer like me this is a instant buy! From Gi Joe,Transformers to random Michel Jackson gloves, the many puns and references keep the humor and nostalgia at a all time high! Can a gamer who know nothing of 80's culture and cartoons like this game? Definitely yes! It has plenty of wackiness and charm to keep anyone entertained.   You play the role of Marty who was granted a magical notebook that looks like a Trapper Keeper. This notebook allows him to use everyday objects as weapons to defeat his foes lead by the evil Commander Hood. Being like a cartoon you play through different episodes and you can play them in any order. As you advance through the game you will find more object's to use and different covers for your notebook that will add helpful stats. You also find stickers that you place on your notebook also giving more stat bonuses.   The visual style is heavily inspired by the classic Paper Mario series having a 3d world with 2d sprites. The graphics look decent but nothing mind blowing. Game play is very close to Paper Mario with the battles being turn based and the action interactive. You will have to time button presses for better defense and attacks. Some attacks are mini games ranging from timing your button presses, gauge building to even classic Simon memory games. This makes the battles extremely fun and interesting at the same time.   The music matches the charm of this game perfectly! Composed by Vince DiCola (Rocky IV and Transformers: The movie) with his partner Kenny Meriedeth (Duck Tales, Power Rangers, X-Men) expect nothing but awesome!   Although this game is short compared to most rpgs it does have some replay value. You have different quests to undertake for each episode and upon beating episodes you are awarded a grade. You are able to replay any episode with all your earned items and levels to try quests you may have missed and also go for a better grade. You also have arena battles where you fight special bosses and endless mode fighting waves of enemy's.   The developer is working on another episode for the fans even though the game is not earning enough revenue for support. Developers like this I respect and deserve support! If you like rpgs I totally recommend this.",
