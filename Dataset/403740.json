            "review_text": "My brain keeps deceiving me as I always tend to read GabeN: The Final DESTINATION. Not DECISION.  GabeN: The Final Decision is simply a game made in RPG Maker as a joke over the weekend. The story is a lot of childish meta gibberish filled with outdated dank memes written with a mentality of a 5-year old who has discovered the Internet just the other day; and yet I believe it makes narratively more sense than a David Cage interactive movie chocking on heroin. But that is like commending this game for something which would be mindboggling. So the story, or the lack of a coherent one (do not worry, even the game warns you), essentially revolves around Gabe Newell, Valve, Illuminati and Gabe’s final decision; yes, how original. Whilst there are a few moments that may make you grin accidently, more so at how bad everything is rather than at any redeemable quality, it miserably fails at any form of comedy. There was potential, but it was all wasted.  The gameplay is mostly always on rails. Whenever the game attempts to throw a puzzle in, it is generally the most dull and badly implemented fetch quest that you could imagine as the random enemy encounter is also absurdly way too high. But that is okey as the battles, which require no tactics and are devoid of any depth whatsoever, always end up just one-shot killing your generic asset enemies. On the other band, bosses can be stupidly overpowered. There is no pace, consistency, balance nor progression in the entire gameplay as also seen by a majority of items and skills which make no sense statistically, leaving you clueless what to do or use half of the time. The developer furthermore put no effort into the game world as everything is bland, copy-pasted and full of large “empty” rooms. From a design standpoint, everything is utterly lazy.   Then there is the disproportionate use of stock assets from RPG Maker and, presumably, royalty-free websites. But I do also believe half of these assets were 'stolen' one way or another. This leads to a lack in personality and feel for the game to at least stand out amongst the rest of the carbon-copy trash games made in RPG Maker on Steam Greenlight. However, the soundtrack can be catchy despite looping poorly at times. Makes you wonder from where the developer “stole” it in the first place.  You would expect such a rushed game to be riddled with bugs, but surprisingly there are no game-breaking ones. Conversely, there are many things which needed to be ironed out such as when either you or your companion dies, at least do not display the deceased party member as if he is still alive. Also, spelling mistakes are present here and there, and it is a headache figuring out whether they were intentional or not.  In conclusion, GabeN: The Final Decision is just another by-the-numbers trash RPG Maker game that gives Steam Greenlight a bad reputation, but it is the exact kind of trash that you should only play it once for the novelty experience when you are absolutely drunk or bored and received it as a free gift from someone. Additionally, it is also the kind of trash where you should shoot yourself for even paying a single penny for it. It would have been received a lot less harshly by the community if the developer would not have had the guts to even ask for an overpriced admission fee for this load of junk. It should have been completely free. Period.  I knew from the start that the game was made as a (poor) parody, so I guess the joke is on me for even giving it the slightest bit of attention by writing all this. But hey, got some free time to kill this evening and free trading cards from a free gift.",

            "review_text": "Okay, just finished this game clocking in about 2.3 hours. I was thinking about this game for a small bit...hesitated playing it because I kept thinking 'RPG Maker garbage. It's gotta be crap'. As usual, the incentive of achievements was laid before me...Well, couldn't be TOO bad, could it? I got this game as part of a giveaway and to be honest, that's as much as this game should be worth, it's NOT worth the price as it feels like a free game.  Play as Gabe New...well...'Gaben' to take down a traitor at Valve and ultimately the Illuminati (confirmed?) as part of revenge for the Illuminati sabotaging the release of the '3's' and destroying Valve HQ. That's as far as the story goes...   The difficulty of majority of the game is that of a beginner JRPG...until the final boss that is. The random encounter rate is very high and there is no point in running away. For most of the game, you'll find that you're basically a tank bulldozing every monster and boss you come across while using the glass-cannon strategy of constantly boosting your strength and shield before blasting your enemies to smithereens.  PROS: Great music choices Nice sense of humor Great references to popular Valve titles and internet culture  CONS:  Pretty short Random monster encounter is too high All of it is easy save for the final boss's final form (which throws the beginner difficulty of the game out the window) Typos here and there  I'll admit that my experience with this title was a positive one. Though I cannot recommend this game for any price, if you managed to get it for free, you should give it a shot. I also hear rumors that this dev is a middle school student. Not sure if this is true, but kudos on the game.  6/10 It's not too shabby. Issues here and there (mostly too easy), but a good way to spend an afternoon.",

The price is a little steep for what it is, yes. And the gameplay consists of mostly tapping enter if you have the right gear. But you are paying for 2 things: the humor (and if you know who these people are it's acctualy pretty funny at moments). And you are helping an aspirering game developer set his foot on the market. That's why even through it's flaws I give this game a rating of 5.9/10",

The first boss is a cakewalk but that goes out the window with the second boss (the nihilanth) where (depending on how much you levelled your charachter's) you'll quickly be brought down to 40hp from 2800hp in a matter of seconds if your not prepared well enough (like I was).  i've only managed to play up until the fire trials room but so far....its a pretty decent game (inb4 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥er's)",

Truly a great spiritual successor to where Half-Life 2 left, this game manages to deliver the same feeling and experience I originally had with Half-Life 2. It's simply groundbreaking and I'm sure it will live up to it's name and soon become one of the most sold titles out there.  While some of you guys might be wondering; 'Why did they change it around and make it RPG this time when it was perfectly fine as FPS?', I can assure you that Valve has really outdone themselves this time. This game is simply put a masterpiece. The soundtrack and sound effects are amazing and so realistic that I first thought someone was shooting outside my apartment. The story is exactly what you'd expect from a sequel to Half-Life 2, full of great dialog and extremely well thought-out character and plot development. Last but certainly not the least, the graphics are amazing. When I first started up the game it took my breath away quite literally. The game world is beautiful to the point where no words can describe it. I can see myself spending hundreds of hours of great quality gameplay time with this wonderful title in the future.  Story: 9/10 Sound: 10/10 Graphics: 11/10 Gameplay &amp; Mechanics: 9/10 --- Overall opinion &amp; score: It's okay. 9/10 ---",
