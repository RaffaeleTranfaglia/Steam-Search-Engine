This game will be unplayable on some people's machines due to this. Be careful when purchasing.  Edit: Testing the game again on a newer computer. Still a non-standard resolution that some computers will have trouble displaying, but it actually does go windowed mode on this machine (the option was greyed out on the original comptuer). Still no word from devs on the forums, so caution is still recommended.",

            "review_text": "This game has one mayor problem: no resolution options. This results in some puzzles being harder to do (like finding hidden objects) but it doesn't make the game unplayable.  Due to this technical problem this might not be a recommendationa at full price.   However, the game itself is pretty decent. The gameplay is good, puzzles are varied and there are plenty of them. The story is surprisingly reasonable and ties in nicely with puzzle solving. Characters you meet are colorful and well drawn, same as the locations.  Overall the game is decent, even with the resolution problem. I had a lot of fun with it but I did get it at a discount so I would definitely recommend it at a lower price point.  At full price it is up to you to decide if you want to get this game",
