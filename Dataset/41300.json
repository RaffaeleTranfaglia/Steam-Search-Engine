I finally came back to the game towards the end of 2015, hoping to relive those happy moments 5 years ago. What I came back to was not the game I remembered. The game was deserted save for 2 football servers (the only gamemode that seems to be played nowerdays). Never the less I hopped in and started playing, 2 minutes later someone in chat say's 'Lol this guy (me) has only played 5 hours' and from there almost everyone on the server started judging me, criticising my every move and mocking every missed shot until I was eventually vote kicked.  This game has changed for the worst. Gone is the variety. Gone is the friendly community. All that's left is a tiny, niche playerbase consisting purely of veterans that push away new players.  What a sad fate for such a fun game.",

ONE negative point though- how are you supposed to get those skins if the point system that you get them with is discontinued?- I could be wrong, and there be a way to get those skins, but other than that- THIS GAME IS AWESOME!

Armed with MGs, Rockets, Lasers and Bombs, you have to shoot down the enemys and survive as long as you can. The game gives you a leveling system, achievments and with that the ability to customize your choose of abilitys you use. Ingame you not only fly an shoot but have basic physical elements like altitude, speed and afterburner. If you get to slow while flying up, your engine will stall and you will fall from the sky. Also you can find one use weapons on the map, that will give you rockets, EMP fields and shields.  The game has a lot of game modes like Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, last man standing and some form of capture the ball mode.  Even if it hasnt that big community anymore it still has usable full functional bots, which arent that big challenge, but still decent and dangerous.  Being able to be played with only the mouse, it is a nice game on mobile devices and a short game for long traveling.",

The mode most worth playing is the game with a ball, though it's been way too long since I've played the game for me to remember what the mode is called. It's like soccer, only in the air and without flopping.  And the U.S. probably wins more often, which makes any sport better.  Anyhow, well-made game that I enjoyed. And then stopped playing.

It's very fun for brief stretches of time, and the server options are customizable to favor both the experienced and the new.   In a sense, Altitude's multiplayer reminds me of the feeling of old-school FPSes with the openness of maps and hectic gameplay. The flight and speed of the varying ships have a bit of a learning curve, but once you find that ship that's 'just right' for you, you'll either feel like a aerial master or a bomber of death.   The levelling system with perks do lock away some interesting abilities, but for the most part, we haven't seen an issue where the perks themselves overpower players. Thankfully, the only real determining factor is a person's piloting skill. Learn to fly, and you can get into this game without a problem.  Keep gameplay short, as playing it for long stretches of time will wear you down.  4 out of 5 foxes.",

            "review_text": "Had I been reviewing Altitude four years ago when it first came out (or even in the year or two after its release), I would give it my highest recommendation. Now, however, I can only barely recommend this game.  The game itself is fantastic. It's a 2D, side-view, multiplayer dogfighting game. The controls are tight, the gameplay intense, and the game plays so quickly (rounds last only a few minutes) that it induces 'just one more game' syndrome. To keep things from getting too repetitive, there are variety of plane types and boosts that can be earned through an XP system. There are also a number of game types - of particular note is the 'ball' game type where players attempt to carry and shoot a ball into the opposing team's goal without being shot down in the process. Scoring the goal is just as exciting as it is in any sports game.  So why can I no longer wholehearted recommend the game? Well, it has encountered the fate that any multiplayer-focused game that isn't as popular as, say Counterstrike, has met: lack of players. There are very few people playing the game now and the few active players left are INSANELY good. Even someone like myself who was half-way decent as a ball runner finds respawning to happen way too frequently.  That leaves two options for enjoying the game: either skirmish against the bots or round up some friends. As with most games of this ilk, playing with and against bots is okay but not a perfect substitute for live players. Perhaps the best way to enjoy the game at this point is to round up a few friends who also own it and host a private game.  Altitude is a great game whose lifespan has run its course. I recommend it for a group of friends or if it goes on Steam sale again (not extremely likely given its age) and creates an influx of new players. Otherwise, I regrettably recommend passing on a game that not enough people enjoyed.",

As you play, unlock a collection of five planes, along with an array of buffs, letting you customize your fighter to your personal style of play (via a perk system like Modern Warfare's). Pack in several game modes as well as a sizable collection of maps, and this indie title gives you variety that'll keep you coming back for more!   Reminiscent of an old-school DOS game I used to play on my 386, Altitude brings back memories. The keyboard controls are as simple as in the good ol' days, but you can also control your plane entirely with the mouse. Instead of the black-and-white pixels of my memories, the graphics are simple, sleek, crisp, and stylized like Team Fortress 2's, giving Altitude a longer future than games that aim for ultra-realism. Games don't need much realism; they need the simple elegance that Altitude has, with it's solid gameplay and balanced variety.",
