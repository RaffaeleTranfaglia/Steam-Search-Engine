One such dimension is the decaying world where Hexen takes place. A world littered with the mangled corpses of nonbelievers and inhabited by the undead followers that executed them.",

Note that you will need to install the latest version of DosBox (free, just google it) on your PC and copy over dosbox.exe to the steam/steamapps/common/hexen/base folder and rename/delete the dosbox.exe that comes with the steam install. Then just rename/delete the hexen.conf file that's in ...hexen/base. Game runs as normal with no issues this way. I tried running the game as steam installs it but it would freeze w/ no sound and have loading issues before you even get to the menu screen.",

I don't really have any complaints about this game, however, it is run on a VERY old MS DOS port. Unless you're nostalgic, download ZDoom and play it off of there. Anyways, awesome game!",

Class-based fps a pet peeve? Hexen does this and much more. Genuine retro sprite graphics and an atmosphere to die for. 3 classes that all play oh-so-differenty with spine-crunchingly delicious arsenal of weaponry to slay hordes of monsters with.   Grab your trusty Figher, Cleric or Mage and go hunt down Corax the Serpent Rider while travelling through different hubs, each with their own dangers, risks and rewards to be reaped! Mabatsekker approves.",

            "review_text": "10/10, this game is quite awesome and makes you feel like a battlewarrior fighting through group of enemies alone. Especially in the beginning level where you use melee most of a time, bashing through enemies to the next level and then later earn weapons. The weapons in this game is quite challenging to obtain, but its quite the effort to get through. Rather than getting a weapon just at the beginning level like other games.  The controls are classic, but you can modernize some controls and you can disable mouse movement.  I had a hell of a time fighting through enemies and fighting bosses, it was quite a struggle even on highest difficulty.  Important note, there are indeed glitches in this game and remember to get a backup save file if you dont want to end up being stuck in the level forever and end up having to start over.  Other than that, i had a great time playing this. Classic games these days really know how to pull this off back then.  Those who plays Heretic, will definitely enjoy this nonetheless and pretty much know what i'm talking about with the controls if you have experience it.  With all that said, enjoy the game if you have thoughts of buying it and you wont regret it once you buy it. Just remember to search up google or search the Steam Community regards of the controls.  Have fun!",

            "review_text": "Hexen: Beyond Heretic was a very surprising game for me. After finding out that, much like its predecessor, Heretic, Hexen ran on the old Doom engine, I expected a typical Doom-esque episodic campaign system. I was wrong and pleasantly surprised when I found out that the game differed noticeably from the other Doom engine games.  You can choose from three different classes to play as, each with their own weapons and stats. The Fighter is obviously the most melee-based class, while the Mage's attacks are all ranged, and the Cleric is sort of the in-between guy.  Unlike what I expected, the game's levels are open-ended (to an extent) hub world with several portals to different areas, giving a unique spin on the gameplay. The game has some parts where you have to solve some puzzles or find semi-hidden switches or interactable walls to advance or perhaps unlock something in another area of the current hub world. The game contains 5 large hubs with about 4-6 sub-areas per hub. I found myself getting stuck often because I would miss a switch somewhere and not be able to find it for a good while, forcing me to revisit every area to double-check every wall and corner for it.  In Hexen, you only get 4 weapons throughout the adventure, your starting weapon, a weapon that uses blue mana, a weapon that uses green mana, and the ultimate weapon for that class that uses both blue and green mana upon use. Similar to Heretic, I found myself often having more mana and inventory items than I would have ever needed, but the game was still quite challenging on Skill 4.  I definitely recommend this game. It has a bit of an RPG spin on the old Doom system, which is refreshing.",

Now I found out about ZGDoom and I redownloaded this game and it's a blast, make sure you download ZGDoom or another program like this to play this game, it's worth your time and money.",
