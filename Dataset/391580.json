Difficult AI No obvious bugs  Cons: Mediocre graphics Hotseat-only multiplayer  8/10. It could use plenty of polish but it's a good way to kill twenty minutes here and there regardless.",

I see a lot of people that are complaining about the graphics, not sure what they are complaining about, this is a board game and most of the focus is on the gameplay. This game is fun when you are playing by yourself or even with a friend! I highly recommend this game for anyone looking fora board game that is out of the ordinary, but easy to pick up!",

This game is like Sorry! the boardgame with the annoying rule to land on the goal precisely. The music doesn't sound anything like Egypt. The pictures are good but there is no animation, just sliding pieces and premade roll of sticks (as dices). The rules are printed in a long text to scroll down instead of a neat tutorial. Overall, who wins the game is purely random and I don't like.",
