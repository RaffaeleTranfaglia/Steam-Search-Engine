It's very interactive and requires you to pay attention to a lot all at once.  I myself find this game to be very enjoyable, and although it has some graphic design downsides like the super simplified main menu and buttons, the exciting gameplay still manages to make me want to continue playing in the future.",

We Are Legion is very well crafted and its obvious that time was put into this game. I would recommend this game to all levels of RTS players. 9/10. -1- Low player amount, training missions there is no actual AI. just preset barrack points.   GET THIS GAME SO WE CAN TRASH EACH OTHER BEHIND ARMIES OF THOUUUUUSANDS.",
