    "description": "Blessed Ones: The Magic Wolves is a silly little fairy tale about wolves (magic ones, obviously) and pigs and adventurers, coming in the form of a japanese-style RPG focused on strategic turn-based combat and party building. It is goofy, flexible, difficult, emergent, and open, in more ways than you might expect!",
