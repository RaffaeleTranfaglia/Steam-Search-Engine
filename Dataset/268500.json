            "review_text": "Listen: At its best, XCOM 2 is a great game and if you liked XCOM EU there is a lot you would like here. The good parts are covered in other positive reviews and I mostly agree with them.  However, I cannot recommend this game as a $60 release in the state it is in.   To be honest, I rarely buy games new at full price because I simply don't make that much money. However, I made an exception for this one because the buzz/preview coverage was very positive and I loved the formula established in EU. They couldn't mess it up THAT much, could they? In my opinion, they didn't and the gameplay experience is mostly great with a few minor quibbles here and there. But even considering that, the technical state this game is in makes me very wary about buying a game at launch ever again. I feel burned.  The most noticeable thing is is that the performance is terrible - I SHOULD be able to run it at ultra or high settings at 60fps but am sitting around medium with occasional slowdown. Honestly it's a minor thing because graphics aren't the biggest deal to me, but it is still something that annoys me given everything else. But if it was the only thing? Totally fine. Unfortunately the bugs in this game are terrible. XCOM at it's best is a tight, no nonense strategy game where you make well thought out, in the moment decisions and live with the consequences. Unfortunately, bugs and crashes interrupt game flow and can make going through missions a slog. I currently have had three crashes in the middle of an action where a crash dialog box would pop up but I would be unable to force quit the game or access the task manager, forcing me to force restart my whole computer. Just my luck as every single time that I happened I was in a hectic situation that was going well for me. At that point I would have to go back to the game, load the last autosave and try and recreate the situation I was in before the game crashed. Completely breaks enjoyment of the game. I've gotten past them, but each time it happens make me less excited to return to the game. I've also had instances where I've completely destroyed all of the walls of a lower floor in the hopes it would drop an enemy from above only to have it not happen? My only guess is that if a ladder connects the ground to an upper floor it makes it so I can't destroy that floor, which is not a bug I guess, but still ridiculous. In that same instance I couldn't target a unit that was behind said ladder despite there being no walls around it and despite the unit not being in any sort of cover.  Right now I'm in a mission where I have to neutralize or knock out an advent VIP. There is a sectopod near the VIP, so I send a unit with chain shot up to try and shoot the sectopod. Presumably both the sectopod and the VIP are in my line of sight, but for whatever reason I can't change between targets - even when clicking the yellow (flanked) VIP icon or trying to tab between targets, it targets the sectopod. That would be fine except every times I confirm the shot on the sectopod, my soldier shoots the VIP. Excuse me? I was able to destroy the sectopod in another way, but only after reloading my autosave and trying to puzzle out how to get the game to do what I wanted (and should have) been able to do. In this same mission, I finally kill the enemies, knock out the VIP, and carry him away. However, when I knocked him out he was next to a burning car. NO MATTER HOW FAR I AM AWAY FROM THE CAR, and NO MATTER HOW MANY MORE UNITS ARE CLOSER TO THE VEHICLE, when the car explodes the VIP takes damage and dies. Once again, even my soldiers who are closer to the car than my unit carrying the VIP don't take damage. Only the VIP.   There are other bugs and crashes, but none quite as egregious or memorable like the ones above. At this point I would have to reload the mission in a previous state to try and figure out a way to get past this particular bug. I don't want to do that and shouldn't have to, frankly. I'm not into Ironman difficulties but also don't like save scumming to get the outcome I want. In this case I'm savescumming because the game is messing up, which just sucks!   At this point I feel like I'm trying to beat the game because I feel obligated, considering how much time I put into it, not because I really want to. And it's a shame because because the gameplay is pretty good and I should WANT to beat it because of how fun it is! But I just never know which mission is going to be the breaking point, where I finally hit a point where my best soldiers die not because of my mishandling but because of the game's mistakes. THAT is problematic and it makes me not excited to return to this game. And maybe I won't. Who knows.   It's been a month now and things aren't really ironed out still. I understand a lot of games ship in various states of disrepair but it shouldn't be like this. Maybe other people can get past these things, and maybe other people won't even come across these issues, but I personally wouldn't recommend buying this game at full retail price until it is patched extensively.  EDIT:  Since writing this review I have played for about three more hours, finishing the campaing. Despite the last mission being mostly great, my recommendation of this game remains the same. Aside from the regular shoddy performance, there were a few bad spots: once again selected one target only to somehow shoot at another, and two instances of not being able to throw a grenade/other item farther than a few squares away with two different soldiers in different locations. Was able to use other soldiers/skills to give me the result I more or less wanted, but still I am annoyed I wasn't able to do what I WANTED to do. Those things did not invalidate the mission as a whole but still muddied what should have been a great experience.  Overall, the game's technical failings are a shame. When firing on all cylinders, this game is fantastic. However, the game's tight flow is too often interrupted by perfomance issues. Given just how IMPORTANT that flow is to making the game enjoyable, it's a damn shame that there are too many instances of you, the player, not being allowed to experience it. You feel like you're hitting a stride, and then all of a sudden a crash or a bug pops up and you stumble through no fault of your own leaving you to deal with the consequences or get back up and try all over again. That just sucks.   Whether you just heard of this game in passing and were intrigued or loved Enemy Unknown, I would highly recommend you do NOT buy this game until there is a hefty sale going on or until it is reliably patched. Preferably the latter. This is a game that should be experienced with no technical caveats as the sytems underneath are enjoyable, addicting, and often rewarding. Unfortunately that time is not now. Or who knows? Maybe you won't experience the bugs I have, as some people didn't. Guess you could just roll the dice.",

            "review_text": "Once again steam reviews are plagued by opinionated people who exagerate the 'cons' to make it sound far worse than it really is, just because there's some aspects in the game they don't like.   I hope I got your attention. Good.   Now as many reviewers have said I will say as well. Most negative reviews talk about performance: MSAA will slice your FPS, turn it off or enable FXAA. There will be a patch soon to optimise it.  Now that we go that out of the way.   X-com 2 is based after the events in X-com 1. You've lost the war, and well.. read the store page for more info. The point is, the game plays like this. You're a resistance cell, not a full fledged world army equipped with the best of everything. Apparently people are down voting because it doesn't play like this. (Get gud?)   The biggest complaint apart from optimization is the mission timers in the battles. Most reviews exagerate the mother loving heck out of this as they hate missions which are timed. Fair enough. There IS a mod which removes this already, so if turn timers are not your thing, there you go.   If a game is going to have timers for missions, then they need to make sense right? Well in X-com they do. They make perfect sense for the missions which have them. You just broke a highly important VIP to the Aliens out of confinement, you're a resistance cell with limited manpower and resources, of course you're going to have to get the hell out of dodge and fast once you break that guy out. It makes sense no? It's REALISTIC. It's IMMERSIVE.. You know.. those things which people apparently hate in games these days.   Setting my own butthurt at societies downfall in terms of gaming aside, the time limit, and how often you run into them is changed depending on difficulty, so if you dont' like timed missions to often, but like them for when they make sense, you can adjust the difficulty level of the game and it will throw less at you.   Apart from that, I love how it feels like you are actually a resistance cell in a mobile base. Scavanging for equipment on the battlefield when enemies drop them, selling parts, corpses, and other alien artifacts on the Black Market to get Intel, and buying/trading/selling in Intel on the Black Market to gain goods to fill the holes of research and bad RNG rolls in battles in terms of mods you find, make it feel like you are the aggressors against a superior foe.   The stealth system in place for most missions is excellent as well, allowing you to scout out the land and enemies before engaging, and setting up ambushes which could wipe the slate in that area entirely before the aliens have time to respond.   There is now a better world map as well, This is where you move your mobile base from region to region, unlock new regions by contacting the resistance cells in that area, and take on side missions to gain supplies, Intel, etc.   -----------------  Over all the game isn't bad by any means. Some performance issues which should be fixed relatively soon, good immersion, great classic game mechanics from X-com 1.   -------------------  If you're still wondering about the complaints on this game. There are 2 people on the forums are can articulate points far better than me. There is ALOT of debate on the timers in this game. These are 2 great responses.     Martial.lore:  The timers are essential. Turtling is not a tactic. The squad isn't trying to find a good picnic spot. XCOM is a guerrilla force that has to make lighting strikes before going back into hiding.  This theme is reinforced by every mechanic in the game from the short individual timers on the globe to the reinforcement drops that come when you just desperately want to get everyone to the evac point.  Sometimes you just have accept that there was not enough time for your ill-equipped soldiers to complete their objective and stay alive, and sometimes sacrifices have to be made for the greater good.  Failure is hard to accept but without the timers the potential for disaster during missions would be missing and the game would not be worthy of the XCOM name.  If it didn't upset players complacency and make them furious at how unfair life is then where is the fun in that? Sometimes FTL makes me very angry but it's one of my favorite tactical video games and I am generally very good at playing it.  Once I have learned how to succeed with XCOM 2 I imagine that even though they will feel familiar and seem easier to deal with, the timers will still screw up a good plan once in a while and get good people killed.  Perish the thought that this were a game in which every move, every action and every decision did not have consequences.     Jolly:  'It mostly IS blind hate against timers. People complaining without really give it a try, or even trying.  'Because most of the timers are idiotic, and pretty much all of them are poorly implemented.'  Um, no. Idiotic? That's opinion and not one I'd agree with. Poorly implemented? It's a countdown on the screen - what do you want, an hourglass? I dancing girl who removes clothes til the 'time' is up? WTF.  Most of the people complaining can't seem to let go of their old XCOM ways. They want to turtle thru full cover overwatch and lure aliens into easy kills. It's a weak 'tactic' that takes advantage of poor AI that suicides into that crap.  The timers, which only appear in about half the missions if you actually play the game more than you cry about it, aren't even for entire missions, usually just for objectives. The cause you to move a little fast, to tak risks, take you out of your comfort zone, and they obliterate the cheeseball reliance on overwatch luring.  What's sad is that if you actually play the game with an open mind, the timers are no big deal. If you just decide you're going to cry about the timers no matter what, which is ignorant, then you desreve the misery you bring upon yourself.  XCOM 2 is a glorious game and a triumph of design. Embrace and love it for everything that it offers, which is a megaton.'",

            "review_text": "Xcom 2 is like playing a chess with a really great looking gameboard and chess pieces. Game is slow-paced and you are supposed to lose sometimes. If you are looking for fast action and immediately results this is not the game for you.  Core gameplay is solid gold. You can have up to 6 soldiers under your command per mission. Missions have different kind of goals and some require to be completed within 8 - 12 turns. Something like 3/5 missions have a turn timer but I didn't find it problematic as I nearly always had 2-3 turn 'spare time' when I completed the mission goal. When people start dying it is often your own fault. There are total of 6 soldier classes, all with unique abilities and skills. Classes feels different with many combinations available how to assemble your squad. If you have played Xcom:EU you learn the new game mechanics within first few hours. All the enemies are new or atleast altered so you don't feel like playing Xcom: EU with a new plot.  Story is interesting and revealed by tiny pieces after completing missions and specific researches. There is a nice pacing with cutscenes and reading when moving forward the main plot. There ain't that many character in the game but they are all well written, besides that annoying little Shen.  In campaign map you make the big decisions: what recourses to get, what region to help, which missions to accept, where to build facilities, how to utilize your staff... You can't get everything, you usually choose what you need most at the time. Making these decions is the most rewarding part of the game.   Xcom 2 is still plagued by performance and optimize issues even the game was launched more than half year ago. Animations lags sometimes even with no action on the screen and they lag like hell when there are multiple fire/acid burning animations going on. Loading a mission can take up to a minute to load and returning to base takes the same. Pretty often there are 10 to 20 seconds 'pauses' during alien turns when the game clearly think what it should do. It is also a pain to board the skyranger as in some missions you have to invidially move all units to extraction area and watch the painfully slow animation about your soldiers getting aboard. Sure this is a minor thing as almost every con in this game but when there are too many of these annoying little things they really begin to affect your game experience. When game is turn-based = pretty slow going you really don't like any additional issues to slow the game down.  There is also one extremely frustrating bug that I have to mention here. Sometimes your soldiers and aliens can shoot through floors/roof when there is accessible multiple-floor building in the map. This line of sight bug has been in Xcom 2 since launch. Some people even argue that it is a feature because 'aliens have supernatural powers and roof has holes for you to shoot through'. No this is not the case, building can be in perfect condition and no one is outside the building to give you vision on enemies but magically you see them loud and clear.  Overall game experience was not as satisfying as Xcom: EU was, still I strongly recomend to try this if you liked the predecessor. It took 30 hours to beat the game on veteran diffulty and game was enternaining right to the end. There are amazing variety of mods available so you can tweak the game to suit better your playstyle/taste. Played with no mods, Anarchy's child and Shen's last gift DLCs enabled and Alien hunter DLC disabled as I had read some horrible feedback about the second DLC.  10 - Perfect game 9 - Excelent game, best of the genre  8 - Good game, worth your time",

            "review_text": "Twenty years have passed since the conclusion of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and we lost. The alien menace has convinced the XCOM council to join them, now calling themselves Advent. Advent has completely taken over the world promising advanced tech, medicine and world peace. The biggest problem is they rule with an iron fist. The XCOM program lives on in the form of a resistance.   Welcome back to the world of XCOM. Enemy Unknown was released in 2012, and a lot has changed and a lot has stayed the same. XCOM, for those unfamiliar with the series, are military strategy games that have always been about decision making. Whether the decision is one about what equipment to build, what tech to research, or giving orders to soldiers in the field; your decisions make the game. This series was one of the first to use permanent death for squad mates.  If one dies, they do not come back. This made players very cautious on how to use their squad, or even which squad mates to send in. Do you send in your most experienced? Or do you take a chance and send in a couple veterans and a couple of rookies? Keeping in mind that, of course, the veterans are better and have more skills, unfortunately, if they die you lose access to all their training and skills. It was also one of the first series to introduce recovery time for injured characters. If a soldier got injured in the field, they need time to recover. Hope you have some reserves.  Where XCOM 2 really shines are with the improvements they made over the last game. In the previous game, players picked where they wanted their base to be. Different locations gave different bonuses. In this game your base is mobile, making you harder to detect and capture. In the command room is a holographic map of the world, and when looking at the it several choices are available at any given time. Should you make contact with a resistance cell in another part of the world? Go steal the supplies from Advent forces nearby? Or should you take out that black site in hopes of securing more soldiers, scientists or engineers? This is a massive switch from the previous game where players really couldn’t move around and all they could do is scan the world for trouble until trouble presented itself.  The alien invasion story has been one of the biggest areas of improvement since Enemy Within. Its characters talk more, fleshing out a story and creating a sense of companionship despite the fact they’re clearly just a cipher for each part of your mobile base’s inner workings. There’s more mystery here, and great cutscenes go a long way to layering on more and more intrigue as you discover bigger,more sinister revelations about the alien’s intentions. To say much more would be a disservice to the great surprises, but the game’s narrative setup - an oppressive occupying force vs a struggling resistance - doesn’t just allow for a greater storytelling: it makes for a much stronger marriage between story and gameplay.  XCOM 2 introduces plenty of new gameplay elements that fit this new style, like player-placed extraction zones, ambushes, and a complete restructuring of character classes to reflect the focus on guerrilla combat. Players will find themselves thinking hard about which classes to bring into a particular firefight, and finding the right combination of soldier types will be a hard-fought trial-and-error process. Likewise, when players start in concealment – a new stealth aspect that is brand new to the franchise – they’ll find themselves tediously organizing ambushes to maximize their overwatch impact.  XCOM 2 is a serious strategy game, even on normal difficulty. The AI rarely makes stupid moves, and will respond to your mistakes with absolutely brutal efficiency. My most common mistake in the first few hours was advancing too far forward with one trooper, spotting a group of enemies, and watching the pioneer get slaughtered with their companions too far away to help. This is a crucial part of how XCOM 2 works – allow your troops to get isolated from each other, or leave a flank exposed, and you’ll be punished.  You’ll need to use every trick at your disposal in XCOM 2, as the ADVENT aren't here to play around. The aliens from the Enemy Unknown have been settled on Earth for some time and are more powerful for it. Sectoids - once the lowest ranking enemy in the game - are now powerful mid-game units that can disorientate and debuff your units while ADVENT troops (humans modified by the aliens) flank and close the distance.  The ADVENT forces are varied and require a considerable amount of tactical thought. Even amongst its foot soldiers there are officers, grunts, sword-wielding assault troopers and heavily armoured damage-soakers. The aliens also bring mechs and robots to the party, as well as more grotesque creatures like the gooey ‘Faceless’ and reptilian ‘Venom’ units. XCOM 2 has gone a long way to make the ADVENT seem both human and alien. Facilities and surroundings will bear all the hallmarks of Earth’s near-future yet be defended by snake-men and dimension-hopping guardians.  As expected your trusty soldiers will gain promotions as they complete missions and kill aliens and like in the XCOM: EU you get to choose one of two skills to unlock. These skills are mostly a new type of attack, but can sometimes be a passive ability like returning fire when attacked or being unable to be hit after killing an enemy the turn before. If you do happen to change your mind, you are now able to retrain abilities using one of the new buildings, the Advanced War Centre, which can also increase the healing down time of injured soldiers,  Combat in XCOM 2 is very similar to the combat from the previous games, each soldier is permitted two actions per turn. These actions can be made up of movements, firing at the enemy, using a grenades, healing or reloading. When you do lay down some sweet guerrilla justice on the alien overlords, there is a chance for loot drops, these can be either weapon upgrades or materials for advanced research. Weapon upgrades are a great addition to XCOM 2, they can add things like increased critical chance, reloads that don’t cost an action or larger ammo clip size and many more.   XCOM 2 has given pretty much every graphical feature in the previous game a polish to update it to modern standards and it goes without saying that the game is flawless in its design and looks. Every battlefield oozes style and really set the scene for your operations against the ADVENT. Soldiers grimace, wince and shout as they fight, while hair, toolkits and weapons sway in convincing ways. Enemy and friendly animations are smooth and detailed - from leaping over barriers to climbing ladders - and I can’t recall any time where my immersion was jarred by clunky movement.  Similarly, composer Tim Wynn has done a fabulous job in creating an epic action-movie feel that accompanies the game. The game’s soundtrack is cinematic in its crescendos and swells and palpably tense when things are going awry. The sound effects are also spot-on: guns crack, rattle and boom while alien mag-weapons make suitably science-fiction pops, zaps and fizzes.  Despite being a fan of the XCOM series as a whole I never expected this new entry to be as polished, intricate, immersive, beautiful and exciting as it is. I’ve had to tear myself away from the screen multiple times because I’d got so invested I’d forgotten to eat. XCOM 2 is one of those titles that appear once in a blue moon and set the benchmark for gaming; from start to finish there wasn’t a moment I did not completely enjoy playing it. XCOM 2 is one of the greatest strategy games of all time.",

There are a lot of glitches that let you say 'WTF' constantly.  The Good: - it IS fun for a while - dense atmosphere - all good aspects of Enemy Unknown/Within still there - nice character classes, loadouts, customization - new aspects on strategic play on the world map  The Bad: - the unpredictable hit probability now hurts with the more powerful enemies, example  * trying to hit a flanked sectoid from the very next square with a gatling, 63%  * aiming an enemy from behind cover = 62%, advancing to half distance, no cover, enemy in front = 70%. Yes, half distance and leaving cover brings a plus of 8% for an uncovered enemy.  * and so on and so on and so on - hit or miss, so missing an 98% enemy on the very next field with the gatling = zero damage instead of reduced damage (this was also an issue on the other XCOM games, but now this is reaaaally painful, because you must not miss!!) - often the pace is too high, both in tactical (often need to rush because of turn countdown) and strategic (several events a day, right from the start, you don't get into it)  All that comes out to gambling. Even if you did everything right when it comes to tactics, you just need one single bad dice roll and you have a killed team mate or even a catastrophe. The game recommends 'veteran' level (second level) for players with XCOM experience, but this only works with a lot of save and reload for me. Far away from Iron Man.  So, if you like the gambling factor in a tactical game, this is for you.",

Cons; Bugs, bugs, bugs  Game breaking bugs if you are playing in iroman. ex: need to EVAC to finish the mission, but one unit is stuck in place and there is no one left to kill her.  Mission failing bugs ex; the warning for reinforcments show up but it the dropzone doenst. Enemies drop (literally) in the mid of my soldiers.  RNG I know the RNG in Xcom can be punishing. But i truly believe there are some problems with it.  70/60% Hacking attemps were failing 80% of the times. The DODGE_GRAZED happens wayyy to much. Two units in full cover, smoke granade on them, far from the enemies. Sectapod one shotted them both with criticals.  (disclaimer: again, i am aware this is RNG based. And as such, maybe i am just unlucky. But again, some stuff happen way too much for me to think its just bad luck)  Enemies teleporting, walking trough walls, walking trough the ground (not kidding) Soldier stuck in animations from attacks or from being attacked (some of them could still be used, though), soldiers teleporting, soldiers unable to use skills Bad FPS, enemies turns taking way to long to process, enemy turns not being processed in camera(by that i mean that the enimies act but the screen is frozen, the it goes back to normal but every enemy already acted)  I saw a lot of these bugs in the streams/videos in youtube. But i figures they were there beacuase of the pre-release version. That was not the case,   And from time to time i get some pretty heavy LOW fps.

THIS IS COMPLETE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T While it is true that an NVidia GT220 is really old, hell as long as a game does not require directx12 it does its job admirably, a GPU that runs crysis 2 on maximum settings ONLINE surely can meet the minimum requirements for Xcom2. I mean come on. I've read on the steam discussions that I am not the first to be told 'your specs suck, not our problem', people who claim to have a much better GPU as well.  Firaxis and 2K have created a broken mess, what about all the thousands of paying customers who complain about horrible performance issues and constant crashes, who definetly have more than the min. requirements? It's a broken launch that they are unwilling to fix, good thing steam refunds are a thing, though I feel very sorry for all those who cannot ask for their money back.  This is the last time I buy a product from Firaxis and 2K, I mean as if broken launches weren't enough, their attitude of 'we support modding' takes form in releasing day 1 extra content as 'mods', giving the playerbase easy to configure .ini 's so the customers can do what the developers couldn't be arsed to do. Amazing.  At least Skyrim and the Fallout series have a lot of base FUNCTIONING content.  I will leave this negative review because this kind of ♥♥♥♥ should not go unnoticed.

At a 20% accuracy shot.   ----------------------old review underneath-----------------   Although I will probably be mostly downvoted by most people, as they are able to play the game, I will nonetheless let my downvote count.   For a huge amount of consumers, myself included, the game crashes on launch without any explanation whatsoever. I'm not going to post my specs and everything, this is a 'review', not a tech discussion thread, there's plenty of'em on the actual discussions page if you're interested to see just how many complain about this game's *HORRIBLE* launch day problems.  And yes, I tried all the fixes suggested, and like so many others, nothing will work. And I'm afraid that when (or if) I will even be able to play it, the FPS won't drop to 10 or less, as so many other people complained of horrible optimization.  Just so you understand the level of customer care the devs gave us today, there was a patch, yeah: it fixed the missing soundtrack included in the Digital Deluxe edition.  Cool, now I can listen to a soundtrack for the game I spent 65€ on without even playing it!   If you're thinking of buying this game, do consider the VERY high risk of not even being able to launch it, my recommendation is: wait a few days to see if the ♥♥♥♥♥torm's settled down.

The new 'stealth' aspect looks like it had no work really put into it. The missions where you start without stealth are the ones where you are stealthier. Guerrlla missions are like the Exalt missions from Enemy Within, the DLC to Xcom Enemy Unknown, except you get punished for making sure your guys dont get ambushed (e.g. Overwatching). At least 80%, not inflating that number, of the missions I ran were timed where you had to exfil (aka leave) the mission in 6-12 turns or congrats! You lost all your best guys, woo. Not spoiling anything, but even the campain is timed. Instead of Enemy Unknown there no 'Saving who you want' and Helping to reduce panic. Nope the game just says straight up 'You're Doomed' and hands you a peice of swiss cheese and says its a sail boat. But dont worry! I am not 100% negitive, there are more customizations for your solders than there are colors of paint at a hardware store. That way when you loose each mission and squad after squad gets wiped, at least they looked FABULOUS! The movement system is all kinds of wonky, but still the only improvment over Enimy Unknown, The aiming got worse, somehow . The new Ranger class is an example, The 60% with a shotgun RIGHT next to an enemy will hit more often than the 91% with the sword.

I made the mistake of not holding to that with XCOM 2 because I loved the predecessor so much and I promptly got punished for it.  In short, XCOM 2 is a great game which improves on XCOM in multiple small ways so if you liked the first one, you will probably LOVE the second.  BUT it has so many bugs and technical problems atm that imo it should not had been released when it did. None of the bugs I encountered was game breaking, but there are so many small annoyances mounting up that I almost put it away on multiple occasions out of sheer exasperation.  The game is still great, don't you believe otherwise. But if you successfully avoided the preorder trap, wait a little longer until they have all (or at least most of) the bugs fixed. You'll get a much less tarnished experience and will enjoy the game a lot more without minutes long loading times, clipping errors, sound cutting out etc.  I am sorry to say, I cannot reccommend buying this game at this point in time.  Edit: Rejoice, for I have been shown the way. I has been made clear to me, that I wrote my review in blatant disregard of the intellectually challenged of our esteemed colleagues out there. But fear not! You just have the one braincell and nothing to rub it against to make it spark? I will take you through it step by step.  Since you read this review, I am assuming that you have not yet bought the game. If you did, what are you doing here? Go play it, it is a good game!  I spent a three digit number of hours in this game, yes. Did I enjoy that time? Yes.... mostly. But I spent almost double that amount on XCOM and far less moments where I wanted to punch through my screen and exactly zero minutes contemplating a critical review.  So assuming you did NOT buy the game yet. From the top of my mind, there are two reasons I can think of why.  A) You desperately want it, but are broke. And while scrounging the money together, you amuse yourself by reading about how good this game is, trampling its enemies into the dust, grinding their bones for your bread and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on their graves. Yay you! Good for you, everybody needs a hobby, I guess.  B) You wanted to see if the game is worth your money and your time. For you, I wrote this review. Is the game worth it?  That depends, do you want a really good game (yes it IS good as my hours can easily testify, even if you subtract the idling time) NOW? Or do you want a great game in about half a year (where realistically at least a few bugs will have been worked out and it will probably have already been on a first 10% sale)?  Chocolate bar now or tub of ice cream later? What I am saying here is that in retrospect, I should have waited for the ice cream. But hey, it's your decision in the end.  Still not getting my point?

But after having played 8 hours of the game and have won maybe 3 out of 15 encounters I gotta say, I'm really disappointed.   It's not that I don't mind a challenge, in fact I was hoping this game would be slightly MORE challenging than Enemy Unknown, but this game is more than just challenging. This game is, for lack of a better term, ridiculously cheap. You've got enemies that can run for what seems like half the map and one shot your soldiers. You've got insanely overpowered enemies that swarm you from all sides early on in the game, before you have any time to research new technologies and have half a chance at winning. You've got multiple enemy types that can incapacitate your soldiers for multiple turns/the rest of the match. So you basically go into every battle with 2 guys you're just sacrificing to the enemy no matter what, and then left with 2 other grunts to try and fight 8 overpowered, cheap, enemies. And, you have a lot of missions with turn limits, which ruins any chance you have to set up any ambushes, and ruins any chance of you having any sort or tactical advantage at all.   This game should be called XCOM: Hurry Up and Die   I'm going to try a new game on Rookie mode and if it's more fun that way I'll update my review but for now, I'm pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ I spent 60 bucks on this.  UPDATE: Started a new game on Rookie mode and couldn't beat the 2nd level. Completed one objective while remaining hidden, immediately got noticed by the enemy even though I was out of sight. Shortly after my opposition went from 2 easy alien soldiers, to 10 aliens. 4 of which were those one shot kill 'stun' baton guys that can run way too far. My entire squad couldn't hit anything they shot at, even at close range with 70+% odds, and then eventually became dead or mind-controlled by a swarm of overpowered aliens. Rookie mode has actually turned out to be more difficult than whatever I was playing last night. I feel ripped off. This game is not fun.",

However, it only struggles when i maximize the settings. If i set them to medium, there will be some framerate stutters here and there. I do not know if this optimization issue is only relevant to the GTX 980, or if it is worse on other cards out there on the market.  The gameplay is the same as the first one, with some annoying things (that can be solved with mods, true- but we're reviewing the game itself here.) The gameplay has to be described as 'annoying' because that's exactly what it is. If all of your squadmates are on the same extraction platform, why do you have to extract each and every one of them individually, why not add an exctract all button? (There is a mod that solves this, however.)  The game continiously annoys the living crap out of you with dialogue, dialogue hindering you from doing anything on your turn. 'We've just recieved a transmission due to X'. Or, one of your officers pop up in the right side window, mentioning you do not have many turns left. Why am I not allowed to do anything while he's talking? And this goes on and on and on in the game! I couldn't bring myself to play it any more. (However, there is a mod that fixes this.)  The worst experience so far- for me, Is the world map. I had one day left on my research, and I started it. One day usually takes 1.5 seconds to pass. This took me three minutes, due to dialogue popping up, that was unskippable, mentionings of the avatar project growing further. The camera pans to where the avatar project is on the map, but does not pan back to where you were before on the map. HALTING your production as well. So, I start it again and another dialogue pops up. It's atrociously annoying!  If you did dislike timed missions in the last XCOM game, then this game just isn't for you. 80% of all missions are '8 turns left to finish before X explodes' or something else. While, it encourages the player to use tactics, it is just too much of it. Almost every god damn mission! (there is a mod that fixes this.)  The loading times are bad, just dreadful.  The game saves itself ONLY because of mods. Mods made by players to fix this boring &amp; annoying game.  I would not recommend you buy this game.

If you don't know it you're screwed. - Turn limits on almost every mission exacerbate balance issues - Bugs galaore. Most are just visual and can be ignored but others affect gameplay. - Major performance issues even with a 980  Wait for balance and performance patches.",

He's the same physical person, but he likes different things, has a different sense of humor, and he is a sore loser at games and often cheats. That's how XCOM 2 feels compared to XCOM. It's not more of the same, but instead it throws out the well balanced strategy layer I and others found fun, and it replaces it with a chaotic mess with a timer that can randomly tick up faster certain months. The resource restrictions feel more annoying than enjoyable, and much of the game feels scripted, the opposite of what any XCOM game should feel like.  In all honesty, I take this personally. I love XCOM and have bought it on PC for myself and others, on XBox, and even on iPhone. This was a day one purchase, but I've put off playing it because it feels like the game is upset with me playing it. The game is no longer well balanced for Iron Man mode and seems to encourage save scumming instead.  To be honest, because I want to beat it and see the ending, I've been playing on Beginner difficulty (with Iron Man selected because I enjoy the perma death aspect still). I've almost beaten it in my sixth game. I've lost five games on normal difficulty and had to resort to beginner just to have a chance, and it's still hard.  XCOM 2 feels like playing a game with a child who cheats and changes the rules. What hurts my feelings is that my favorite game is XCOM, so this feels like an old friend who has changed who he is for no reason and has become a sore loser to boot.",

            "review_text": "While I'm still playing through the campaign, I can say that XCOM 2 is overall a well-made game, but there are some downsides with it. For me, mainly two: the game isn't as optimised as it should be, I'm running a 650 Ti 2GB currently but I feel like it should be able to run the game at higher frames (although the game has never outright crashed). I also feel like the difficulty of the game needs some tweaking - I've been playing on the second difficulty and it feels too punishing in certain areas.   If you make one mistake in your research, mission choices or facility choices, you can find yourself in completely frustrating situations, like not having enough squad member slots, or wasting all your money on new soldiers because you didn't buy the facility needed to use the speed boost that heals your current soldiers faster and in time for the next mission. Once you realise your weaknesses and start trying to correct them down the road, the Avatar counter will keep ticking up as expected, not giving you enough time unless you want the red bar almost completely filled by the time you're prepared for the mission.  Making these types of oversights can make the game extremely tedious unless you constantly revert saves, which isn't how you want to play it. You can find yourself saving after every mission so you can revert to any point of the game and change your choices so that you can avoid the problem that made you revert in the first place.  Overall, good game for strategy players and one that improves on Enemy Unknown. Don't buy if your graphics card is old or if you don't want to constantly revert saves or constantly lose all time and effort you invested into your playthrough.  (Yes, I understand XCOM is meant to punish bad decisions, but personally I feel it went too far in that direction and could have been more forgiving at least a few times, especially on the first two difficulties).

The recent patch did not improve the situation whatsoever. Simple gameplay is made frustrating and this ongoing issue has totally taken the joy out of the game.

How do every animation looks worse now? wont they ever learn? just pay attention to EVERY SINGLE dying enemy, the ragdolls are ridiculous. Lacks proper closure, explanations and is excessivelly supernatural even for an 'alien' game. Late game, you may ask yourself why you even need a gun when there's X Y Z factors present (i'll not spoil)   However that is not the worst, X-COM is known for it's difficulty, and this one derailed badly on this behalf. Best case scenario, forced a challenging concept that should have been left in the 90's. Time or turn limit, whatever people want to call it, is the plague that affected this game even in before release, that wich is clearly a disgusting attempt to compensate for the terrible (brute force oriented) A.I. Pretty much the same as it's predecesor XCOM:EU  Bad review? so what else is wrong with it?  -The game may simply not launch, forcing a validation check, that may or may not work -Bad support -Glitches, promotions sometimes simply do no work until going through the next mission (one last rookie ride maybe?) -Even on high end machines it stutters horribly -Every action has a 1-2 seconds delay, afterwards it may freeze for 3-5 second by the end of the action -Every cinematic has a 'hiccup' or small freeze -Lip-synch is laughable -Animations are clumsy and not fluid, not to say that they actually defy the laws of physics -Shooting through walls/doors/windows and corners! never stay on a corner because it doesnt not block the line of sight as it should! -Melee attacks over walls/doors and windows as well... -The plot is weak, too many questions, not enough answers -Over supernatural even for alien stuff with kame-hame-ha shows going up and down. -Over novelized, terrible closure -End game armors/weapons are extremely generic -MASS EFFECT COMPLEX (this one assures a bad review by its own)  Now so I'm not being biased or simply unfair, there are the pros. It's a newer game after all, the graphic is overall better but at some heavy hardware cost, the maps are beautifuly crafted, cannot lie about that, and the customizations is awesome as well, you could spend hours just customizing your squad with very unique appearances.  TL;DR on top of the foul turn limit system, its plagued by technical issues and lacks the 'smooth and polished' feel for such a title. Wait for patches and fixes, you won't be missing anything, and will save yourself some few gray hairs.",

            "review_text": "XCOM is back and aside from a few annoying details, it's better than ever.  Virtually every area of the game has seen an improvement in some way. The strategic layer, combat, classes, soldier customization, enemy AI, enemy variety, mission variety, maps, resource management, all improved. But optimization and overall polish has definitely taken a hit, and there are a few questionable decisions that hold it back from being perfect.  On the strategic layer back at the Avenger, managing your base's allocated space has seen a pretty drastic overhaul, and the new contact system replaces the satellites of previous games. In general, you have a lot more control over what missions you take and what you spend your time doing, instead of always passing the time by scanning for activity like in Enemy Unknown. Now as different scanning opportunities pop up with all different kinds of rewards, you can proioritize which place you'd like to take the Avenger to scan based on the rewards that each location gives out.  As far as managing your space goes, the new upgrade system is a welcome improvement over EU. Now you don't need to wait until late-game to get the most out of building generators, for instance. When you unlock the next level generator that increases output, you can just upgrade the generators you have. It's a system that punishes you for early building considerably less than EU did. In addition, each facility can now be staffed with engineers, which are a resource that you'll gather over the course of the game. Staffing facilities gives different bonuses depending on each facility, and you can switch up which facilities are staffed on the fly to focus on what you need at any given time.   Combat is much the same as EU and EW, with some subtle refinements and UI improvements here and there. Grenades and explosives are more powerful and more important now, as you'll often fight armored enemies who need to have that armor shredded by explosives before they become vulnerable. Verticality plays a larger role now as the new maps are built more with setting up for height advantages in mind. The procedural map system works brilliantly and honestly feels like these maps were handcrafted.   Each of the replacement classes for the classes from EU is a step up from the last game, and each one has two distinct paths of skills that almost make each side feel like their own class. The Ranger replaces EU's Assault class, and can be specced for stealth melee or a shotgun vanguard. Sharpshooter replaces the Sniper and be specced for pure sniper or as a gunslinger (a pistoleer that actually has distinct advantages over a sniper -- I once took shots at 8 aliens in one turn using the Faceoff skill that lets you take a free shot at every enemy in range). The Specialist replaces the Support and can be set up as either a field medic or a hacker, and comes with a drone that allows him to heal or hack remotely. The Grenadier replaces the Heavy and can be either a demolitionist focused on explosions or a heavy machine gunner that focuses on the usage of miniguns. And there's a fifth class this time around, the Psi Operative can be acquired earlier in the game than Psi troopers of EU, and is its own distinct class with tons of great abilities. My favorite is being able to permanently mind control one enemy per mission. And the best part of all of these classes is that you can mix and match skills from both sides of each class, so you have a lot of freedom in builds.  Soldier customization is great. You have a lot more control over how your soldiers looks, with customizable faces, names, nationalities, bios, props like shades, headbands, bandannas, headgear like hoods and helmets, full control over weapon and armor color, you can add patterns to weapon and armor (and might I add, weapons and armor can be customized separately), you can pick variants armor torsos, arms, and legs (except for the middle tier of armor -- you can't change the torso there for some reason) and can even upload your characters to a global character pool so the people you've created will appear in future playthroughs. One big missing feature: If you save a character, you can't load that appearance/description onto a rookie, you just have to hope you bump into that soldier again randomly if you want to use him. To that end, I refrained from using the character pool and will just manually recreate my soldiers next time if I want to re-use those characters. But you can also create characters to be engineers, doctors, or bad guys if that's more up your alley. And finally this one is to Firaxis (thanks for reading, Jake): Give us some more helmets, please. Such a great selection in EU and EW and yet there's only a handful in XCOM 2, and they don't look so good.  Now for some negatives: The game is not optimized well. At all. Back at the Avenger it's not uncommon for dips down to 10-20FPS, and I have a capable rig playing on reasonable settings. I had better performance on missions after the initial ten-second stuttering as the map first loads, but many people have terrible performance all around. Here's hoping Firaxis addresses this in a future patch and manages to make this game more playable for more folks. It's unacceptable that a game in 2016 that was delayed and made exclusive for the PC runs this poorly, especially when the visuals, while ultimately good, are nothing crazy. There are also frequent hitches like the game hanging in between turns, actions taking longer than they should to start/stop playing, UI and sound bugging out. It's hard to understand why the game shipped like this when Firaxis generally knocks optimization and overall polish out of the park.  Mission timers. Oh boy. Mission timers are a divisive topic within the community. Some people love them, some people say they ruin the game, some people don't care much either way. I played on normal ('veteran', as it's known in-game) and won my first campaign, and on normal the mission timers are very tolerable. On higher difficulties however, the general consensus seems to be that they're only there to force you to rush and make mistakes. I definitely agree that they're artificial difficulty at best and while they didn't bother me so much at my difficulty level, if I had the choice, I probably would have disabled them. They didn't detract much from the game, but at the end of the day they didn't really add anything.  Wounds. My biggest gripe with the game. Injuries for your soldiers are much, much more prevalent this time around than they were in EU. If a soldier takes any hit, no matter how strong their armor is, and no matter if they get healed with a medkit, they're wounded. Wounds come in three flavors, lightly wounded, wounded, and gravely wounded. Grave wounds last up to an in-game month, and while this isn't so bad in the early game, by late-game you're going to be on missions where high-ranking soldiers feel almost mandatory to counter what you're up against. There's a facility where you can staff an engineer to cut recovery times in half, and even then the amount of time your soldiers spend wounded is obscene. The EU system of soldiers only being wounded when they take more damage than their armor adds to their health was much, much better, and I hope this new system is addressed in a patch.  Negatives aside, the game that we got is pretty much just EU but bigger and better in every way. It's not perfect, but what is? It's got some problems, but what doesn't? I would still wholeheartedly recommend this game to anybody, especially people who liked Enemy Unknown.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR? = Unenjoyable, Every mission felt like a chore, stupidly flawed probability system, missions gradually become impossible to complete, game forces you to play how it wants you to play, timer to beat the game makes it virtually stressful and unrelaxing.   I personally enjoy turn based games with a strategic and tactical element implemented to make you feel like a commander of a fireteam. This game fits right in there but with major disappointing twists that have rendered it unejoyable and everything about it is forced onto you. In addition, one thing I HATE the most about this game is the element of probability, and not just that but the probabilities you get in terms of a successful hit are very unrealistic and just straight out annoying.  In the beginning of the main campaign, I was having fun. Missions were playable, but only easy if you knew how to position your fireteam and target the most lethal and threatening enemies first while taking care of your own team in order to suffer little to no losses or damages. I was mastering that pretty well. The enemies I faced were a suitable match to the soldiers and lack of equipment I had to begin with which was fair enough. Then came this AVATAR project. Now I understand Firaxis wanted something unique, but to implement some sort of timer required in order to beat the game well thats just thrown any form of relaxation and joy of the game straight out the window. Then enemies staretd to become harder, and I couldnt keep up with improving my team and equipment. The game forces you to use your veteran teams more often due to the sudden rise of difficulty. Leaving you with no chance of using any additional rookies to promote them and give them access to better equipment. The further into the game I got, the more stressful it became when you lost even one soldier (who was either a squaddie or Cpl) because that meant you needed to replace him/her, but that was vitually impossible because I have now reached to that part of the game where every mission I play now is extremely difficult for rookies. I then eneded up having to restart because I kept losing soldiers bit by bit after every mission. How I was losing them I will explain later.  Now the missions themselves I believed were forced onto the player. You're given a mission to do in which although you have an option to skip it, you will suffer a serious penalty if you do. Now you're probably asking, why would you want to skip it anyway? Well maybe because I was in the middle of picking up a supply drop and researching equipment to further improve my fireteam, and I know that if I don't finish those researches then I won't stand a chance in hell in doing any further missions. I understand that sacrifices have to be made sometimes in order to complete a mission, but sacrificing after every mission makes any future missions impossible to complete. It's stressful enough that you need to spend time in collecting supply and researching equipment in order to keep up with the mission difficulty, but then to stop me mid way and literally URGE me to do this mission or I suffer a penalty, its just silly. I also understand that they make us do these missions so that we dont go ahead of the difficulty and enter a mission with a fully kitted out fireteam making the mission a walk in the park, but the difficulty is already way ahead, after the fact that I lost two soldiers from the previous mission, and I had to waste supply recruiting more which will be useless because they dont have the equipment to even survive for two turns in the next upcoming missions (sorry for abusing the word 'missions').  Now onto the stupidly flawed probability system. 6 out of 10 ten times I was given a probability of a 70%+ chance of hitting the enemy and I end up missing. 2 of those 6 misses my soldier was in point blanc range of the enemy. Not only that but on several occasions my soldiers were behind full cover and end up getting critically hit back to the stone age as if they were sitting ducks out in the open (and no they weren't being flanked because the sheild symbol was still blue and not yellow). You were doing a good job killing off the enemy fire team with no wounded soldiers because you mastered the arts of flanking and cover just to have one alien, suddenly blessed by the vision of god and snipe one of your guys who was behind a brick wall. I stopped beliving it was due to unluckiness and started thinking that it was just plain bull, since it happened consistently.   Overall, the game became less enjoyable after every mission. The missions started to feel like a chore instead of actually being hyped to do them. The probability system works against you and in the favour of the AI, despite following every rule in the book when it comes to a turn based, stay-in-cover-and-flank game. The game makes you play how it wants you to play, and any diversion from the 'script', and you get severly punished.   2/10 would not get critically sniped behind full metal cover again.",

            "review_text": "Its times like these that I wish Steam had a sideways thumb as this is not a bad game by any means, however it does suffer with a couple of issues.  Let me start by saying that I believe Xcom 2 has the potential to be a great game, it has all that I would like in a Turn Based RPG and I’ve only just scratched the surface, however there are a few balance issues that need to be remedied that make certain things in the game impossible. I have played just under 10 hours on veteran mode on the opening weekend, and have had some really good moments, however there are certain issues which I know will eventually nullify my enthusiasm.  1) Cover  Cover seems to be a bit pointless. More often than not I lose full health squad members who are either in full cover or in half cover (I understand half cover isn’t always guaranteed). On one occasion I was flanking around the side of a garage with two troops at full health. Soldier 1 was behind a road block and soldier 2 behind the garage wall, this gave me both Half-Cover and Full cover respectively. However this didn’t seem to matter because soldier 1 was hit at distance and died instantly loosing 5 health. Soldier 2 was shot through 2 solid non damaged walls and again was killed (How the enemy would have seen her I don’t know). That doesn’t leave a lot of room for setting up your team and formulating a tactical plan if the enemy can just shoot through cover as if it wasn’t there, this for me is a major issue. I feel that either the enemies are too overpowered or the cover isn’t working as it should do. Surely a concrete roadblock would assure a smidgen of protection. In another instance, I had a full health rookie behind a barrier; the enemy melee unit ran all the way up so he was positioned on the other side of the barrier (half-cover) and killed me with one thwack to the head.  2) Timed Goals  I have no problem with the idea of a timed goal; however there are 2 issues I feel need to be addressed: a) Harsh countdown times - The timed goals given are on the whole too short, running and gunning doesn’t work as combined with the above issue of cover being like jelly, it makes getting to the goal impossible and in most cases I lose the majority of my team getting there, just to have to spend all of my supplies on new recruits and thus getting stuck in a vicious cycle. (and this was in the Early game). b) Random reinforcements are too penalising, as you just have barely enough time to get to the goal. But add in the fact that 75% of the time, reinforcements form behind your team, and just mop up with 1 shot kills. From what I’ve played of the game, there’s a lot that I’ve enjoyed, there's a lot of potential and I’m genuinely excited about it, but I personally feel there needs to be a re-think when it comes to the cover situation and the harsh countdown timers.  There are also a few performance issues that I believe are being looked into, however, I’m not as badly affected as some. ",

The game is beautiful probably more so if I could max the settings without it crashing! it plays well and improves beautifully on the Xcom franchise to which I am a great fan and played the originals for 200 hrs minimum. But I am just tired of publishers and AAA studios getting a free pass whenever they like. Compatability is just as important to gameplay, story and while visuals are great they are not the key to having a great game.

Perhaps an unpopular opinion as clearly there is a huge segment of the player base who love the 'Long War' mod and studio, I personally do not. I simply do not share their vision for the game or the way they prefer to play XCOM, and unfortunately XCOM 2 entirely caters for this audience.  I've finished XCOM 1 several times and played the originals to death, but I've only gone through about 33% of this one and I find myself mostly frustrated or with the feeling that I'm missing something.  And then I realise that I spend more time looking in the workshop how to fix things I don't agree with, than actually playing the game.  So, whilst this is in essence quite a good core game, it has a ton of bugs with performance, line of sight and other issues and suffers horribly from the input and influence of the Long War team.

It continues what XCOM:Enemy Unknown started and improved it.  The good:  - it's everything I love about XCOM - a lot more diverse set of terrains in the tactical layer - creatively redesigned classes (they are still good but different enough to think a bit - cool new weapons - finally you do not have to take the damn things alive - finally, faces - soldier customisation options through the roof - loot system - time limits that add a sense of urgency to the gameplay - concealment for all your ambushing needs  The mediocre: - acceptable storyline that somehow manages to wriggle out of the confines of XCOM:EU's ending - solid characters - decent ending - some soldier development options were useless for me (think twice before choosing extra armor for the Grenadier instead of armour shredding capability) - plenty of bottlenecks in the game, got to think three steps ahead (I like it but it can be frustrating at first)  The bad: - ridiculous misses in the tactical gameplay (five missed shots in Overwatch, hell yeah!) - line and splash effect placements are wonky (double-check the affected area before launching a grenade) - the Hellish Stutter may still be present on some rigs, I dunno - solid surfaces can be seen through at times, ending in megatriggers (you will see what I mean).

This can grant random armors, ammo, grenades, or utilities which is really neat  Cons: -Extremely obnoxious turn limit timers that sometimes make no sense. On one VIP mission I had 8 turns to get the hostage and leave, and there were about 15 aliens in the way to the exit and it also made no sense that the timer started ticking down before I was even discovered. I'm all for added dificulty, but not at the expense of reason, because there is no reason at all of why you would be limited in turns when the aliens already found you and reinforcements already arrived. You should be able to maybe fight off a huge invasion if you take too long, it shouldn't just end and not give you a chance. (There are mods to fix this problem however, as they increase turns) -On top of these turn timers, the Avatar project is constantly ticking away as well, though I haven't looked to see if there is a mod to slow it down, I am sure there is or will be one.  Overall: 9.5/10 - Improved every aspect from XCOM 1 and there is in depth character customization for your characters that will probably be killed in a few turns.",

Seems like lots of developers have added so many postprocessing effects to UE3 over the years that it's getting difficult to optimize well... and using a wrapper rather than doing OpenGL builds for OSX and Linux doesn't help. There's also hilarious bugs like the game thinking 12 PM is midnight and 12 AM is noon as far as your savefiles are concerned -- of course, _only_ C++ doesn't have a standard library to handle this for you, but that does suggest a minor lack of polish.  - The base-building optimization puzzle is a little too solvable, but it's the sort of thing you'll inevitably get wrong the first time through. This carries through to a lot of the game's design, where you seem to be encouraged to savescum or fail on your first time through, with neither option being particularly satisfying. There's no reason this game couldn't have borrowed Invisible Inc's autosaving-with-a-fixed-number-of-rewinds mechanic as an alternative to Ironman mode, and it'd have been better for it.  - Late game has a bit of Civ syndrome where once you've seen all of the tech it's a bit of a slog to push through to the very end.  - Narrative comes on too strong at the start with all of the military stuff and the power fantasy of repeatedly addressing the player as 'commander,' though the mid-game scripted events are well-handled.  - The starting swords are ridiculously anachronistic.  This is already a good game, but I expect it will be much, much better in a year. It's probably fair to be frustrated by that in the meantime.",

Although it launched with varied performance issues, and some... 'interesting' bugs, the performance is pretty easiliy tweaked and the bugs are not so much game breaking as they are... weird. Mostly visual delays during the alien turn that leave you pondering what is going on until the turn ends and animation catches up and normalness resumes.   Deeply rich campaign strategy and very very satisfying tactical combat. The turn counters add just enough pressure to make sure you're not quite comfortable while giving you the time for intelligent decisions and ultimately, victory. Even though about 75% of the missions had timers for me, the ones without the timer still kept me on my toes with the very difficult combat.   Literally improved everything we loved about EU/EW and added new features and combat mechanics.  Highly highly recommend this game to fans of the previous installment. Though the difficulty has gone up significantly! New players be warned! This is not a relaxing game but a stressful challenge to put your wits to the test! (brutally difficult but very winnable). And oh so satisfying when you obtain victory against overwhelming odds. Looking forward to many playthroughs.   STRATEGY GOTY.",

Windows 10 Gtx Titan x SC edition i7 3770k @ 4.3ghz 16gb ddr 3 1tb samsung evo ssd 960gb sandisk ssd  1. Game crashing to the point that my pc either restarts itself or I have to hard restart. The game crashes 90% of the time i play it, this is not an exaggeration. 2. Very poor performance - the fps are all over the place, the game is way more demanding than it should be - relative to how it looks and the amount of action taking place at any given point. 3. My soldiers or the enemy shooting each other through solid cover and other line of sight obscuring objects. 4. Action cam showing bullets actually hitting the enemy and then registering as a miss. 5. Sound bug where only the music remains and all other effects are not played or are very muted. 6. Stuck animations, i.e. the constricted animation not ending after constriction has been released.  When Batman AK and BF4 launched they both released in better shape than this game and were torn to pieces by the media and gamers alike, somehow it feels like Firaxis have gotten away with it and I have no idea why. It is incredibly disrespectful to your fanbase to expect payment for such a poor quality release; goodwill doesnt come easy and it feels like Firaxis need a reality check.

It is – without exaggeration – one of the best, if not THE best turn-based strategy I played in this decade. It is thematically refreshing, cinematic where it needs to be and tactically demanding. And by 'tactically demanding', I mean hard as ♥♥♥♥. Yes, you heard me correctly; so if you consider yourself to be a rather casual player of strategy games, you should sit this one out. This game is cruel and unforgiving; I had to restart my campaign after 14 hours of gameplay just because I had made so many tiny mistakes along the way that, when accumulated, they created a scenario that was unwinnable. Nevertheless, if you take your time, learn from your past mistakes and never cease to improve your tactics, you will, eventually, experience one of the greatest feelings – beating the game for the first time. And for a while, you shall feel truly unvincible... I mean, until you try the Ironman mode and get your ♥♥♥ handed to you all over again.

A lot of negativity I have seen is about performance, I obviously can't speak for everyone and I am not a 'hardcore' PC gamer by any means, I bought an Alienware X51 3ish years ago and have not upgraded it in any way and would not know where to start if I had to, my PC is between minimum and recommended specs, i5 processor, NVIDIA GTX 660, 8GB RAM and the game runs fine for me. I should say I have never looked at FPS counters in games and would only complain if the game was stuttering and impeding my ability to play the game and it isn't, I have noticed some stuttering in the cut scenes and a few times the camera pauses for a few seconds too long but that's it so far - I should also say I have not touched the graphics options so far and am just playing on what the game recommended for my PC on launch so I could probably improve the performance more so if needed.  People have also complained about turn timers, I was unsure at first but really like them now, great feeling when you extract your squad with only 1 turn to go! Makes the game more interesting for me - I used to camp and try to draw the enemy to me in the first game which artificually lengthened missions and did bore me occasionally, I cannot do that any more, at least on the majority of missions and I love it. The timers also fit the 'guerrilla' theme of the game which I love. I have noticed there are already mods available to remove and tweak the turn timers as well so this could help people who cannot learn to love the mechanic.  Also, the fact modding is intergrated through the steam workshop is brilliant as it makes it more accesilbe to people like me and will only go onto enhance the game and increase it's longevity - which will be good anyway as this games is made to be replayed!

            "review_text": "34 hours in, playing on Commander 'Classic' difficulty. I highly recommend this game.  This is a great game, but you need to go into it like playing poker. You are going to make bets. A good player makes good bets but understands that sometimes you can lose even when making the 'right call.' This is why good players do not simply know who is more likely to 'win' in a binary sense, but what is an appropriate amount to bet. Along these lines, you must know when to raise, when to go all in, and when to fold. Preserve your chips for when the odds are highly in your favor, risk little when they favor your opponents.  This is one of the only games I have ever played that actually has an organic concept of a 'phyrric victory,' where you can literally lose the campaign by winning badly a couple times in a row. A lot of people are complaining about the 'mission turn counter,' but I would tell you not to listen to these people. Tight turn limits are an essential element in forcing a very interesting decision of how much you want to risk to achieve victory, and at what cost.  For example, I suspect many players (including me) immediatly go for all the 'output damage' talents on their soldiers in all cases. However, later in the game accidentally pulling multiple packs is a deadly mistake. Using scouting talents or soldiers allows you to push quickly toward an objective while reducing the risk of engaging in an unintended large fight. And if that fight does, unfortunately, happen (as it sometimes will), you have a choice to make: pull the squad out immediatly, or win the fight with heavy wounds? This is not a game where just winning is enough. How you win matters, and the tactical level is intimately tied to the strategic level in this regard.  There are some annoying technical issues, but they have not impacted my play experience. YMMV.  This game is hard, but it is fair. Furthermore, it is a game where the computer AI is a worthy opponent and doesn't cheat, which is IMO a huge accomplishment for a turn based strategy game. If you are the kind of player who loves turn based games for their slower, 'thinking man' style but is frustrated by the lack of fair challenge out there, you are in for a treat with this one. ",

Some groups of enemies have patrol routes, which makes for a more interesting tactical experience. Timed objectives occur more often - though not with the frequency those complaining about them would have you believe.  New soldier skills have been added, and some modified to liven up combat. Rangers carry a blade for close combat and sharpshooters are now the only pistol carriers. Both these classes acquire specialized skills for these weapons.  Altering soldiers' visual appearance and history has reached a new high. You can write their bio, change their country of origin, and accessorize - with more options opening up as they level. You can even color and name their weapons. On the down side, the base physical features of each race seem more homogenized and less country specific.   Lots of attention to small graphical details has been taken throughout the game. Soldiers have grim, tense expressions flying to a mission, and cheerful, relieved expressions flying back. The intro loading screen will pick a soldier on your roster ( in their current gear ) and show them spying on an Advent position. You can give your soldiers cigars and cigarettes, earrings, scars and tattoos.   The downside of all this graphical goodness is that it comes at a price. If you've been nursing along an older computer system with infusions of RAM and a slightly better graphics card, you may not be satisfied with how the game runs. There are a lot of options in the graphics setup, so it is possible to find a setting that is bearable on an older system, but it won't be pretty and frame rates will stutter on some weapon effects.  Before XCOM2 i've been playing XCOM EW with the Long War mod. While XCOM2 is definitely an improvement over the base XCOM EW, I have mixed feelings on how it compares to the Long War modded version. Graphics aside, more different than better.    Pros Graphically improved. More varied maps and missions New soldier skills Involving story  Cons Hefty system requirements Not fully optimized for performance.   If you liked XCOM EW and your computer can handle the system requirements, definitely give XCOM2 a go.",

            "review_text": "This game could have been awesome.  It does not give nearly enough time to complete anything without failing critical missions. If you do focus on critical missions and skip most upgrades and research, you will be vastly outnumbered and far from powerful enough. I do not have a whole lot of turn-based strategy gaming experience, but even on the EASIEST setting (which is suggested in-game for non-experienced players), the difficulty scales way too fast with your progress and quickly becomes impossible. The tutorial gave hardly any hints and tips, leaving the player to figure everything out on their own whilst getting their butt kicked. There are also strategy-critical BUGS throughout the game that tilt to the enemies advantage (for example, enemies shooting through two walls before they are destroyed, or enemies slashing your squad members from below you). A 4-man squad is absolutely ridiculous when you have many more soldiers to spare, especially when going up against 10+ enemy units. The Dark Events are also relentless and make the enemy much too powerful. It is also frustrating that there is no way to take the time to counter all the Dark Events. In fact, you can't 'take the time' to do much at all. The entire game rushes the player through everything, interupting progress with side missions that are far too detrimental to lose. There are also several aspects that don't make sense and uselessly inhibiting of a good game experience.   Now that I've got that off my chest, here's what I find amazing about this game.   The platform is easy to use. Graphics, landscape, splash art, the alien concepts, these are all beautiful and very attractive. This game has a unique blend of action and story progression, which I find very enjoyable. The aliens themselves are decently authentic and fun to discover and fight. All of this alone ALMOST makes up for the rest of my frustrating experience.   Conclusion:  This game was a complete joy to learn about and explore for several hours, but became a complete mess of failure and frustration rather quickly. I have a bit of regret paying $60 for this. I'm sure there is a very specific way to play this game and do quite well, but it is not obvious at all. I do not enjoy having to go research how to actually play to feel as though my purchase is worth (which I will do now) and would much rather be able to learn and explore everything myself with a successfully challenging experience. Perhaps my review will change once I do some digging.  4/10",

        {
            "review_text": "Overall Gameplay Thoughts: (everything could contain spoilers) In the early parts of the Game, XCOM2, you feel like a bad ♥♥♥. Running and ducking behind cover. Laying down suppressing fire with your grenadier as your ranger flanks around the side, taking a shot with their bolt caster. Making tough trade off decisions of cover, movement, and firing. And when something goes wrong XCOM2 punishes you for it.  You think of new tactics as you go on, setting up a sniper with the squadsight and death from above abilities in the back on top of a building offering great support, or charging in with you Grenadier, hoping to ambush enemies and group them for devastating frag grenade attacks.  Unfortunately, every developer has to tread the risky proposition that their game becomes redundant as the game drags on. While I never felt bored to the point I would simply walk away from the game, I began to dread those red alerts that meant I was forced onto a mission late game, because I knew it would be another 30 minutes to an hour of run, cover, shoot. While new aliens presented a new challenge, they're charm began to wear off after the second or third mission of seeing them.  There got a point in the game where it was just, 'okay, you're not offering me anything new here, it's time to end the game.' New aliens, new abilities, don't innovate the game, they unfortunately just offer another button to push, and they became redundant. It's why I would say this game is good, but not great.  If I had one major complaint of the game, it was that whenever trying to do something, like scanning an area, or trying to get additional intel at headquarters, the game was constantly interrupting you with other things. A 5 day scan would be interrupted 5 times with new missions, a mission that you couldn't bypass because it'd increase the Avatar tracker, research, building a new facility, etc. What seems like a simple task became an ordeal. I have no idea how to fix it, it just got annoying.  Mechanics: XCOM is a tactical turn based game where you play behind the eyes of 'Commander', a bad ♥♥♥ military commander who wins more often than he (or she) loses. In this role, you control a small group of soldiers, slowly giving them better equipment, weapons, and abilities. Flying around the world in the Avenger, you take on missions, each mission requiring the deployment of these soldiers. Each mission has a goal (destroy the transmitter, save as many civilians as possible, destroy all enemy forces, etc.) that you are required to complete to finish the mission, gaining rewards like additional supplies, an engineer, weapons, building materials, etc.  In addition to missions, occasionally the game provides you with points of interest you need to fly to and scan. Scanning can take days, but doesn't require troop deployment, often providing many of the same (but fewer of) rewards as above.  While doing these, the aliens are trying to perfect their Avatar project, a mysterious project with a 10 block timed countdown, your actions of which will either increase of decrease the timer. I have no idea what happens when you hit that final block, but you get the idea it will be bad.  Supplies Supplies are the main currency of the game. Used to build additional facilities, buy from the black market, hire additional resources, build researched items, and a number of other items. You get these mainly from completely missions and from making contact with additional sections of the world, which contribute supplies in a monthly supply drop.  The game handles supply management fairly well. At times I would run out, but there was always something to do such as missions, scans, or the black market that I could make the decision to spend time and resources to get additional supplies.  Intel Gained from missions, points of interest, and flying back to headquarters. You use intel to make contact with new regions and a variety of other tasks.  Research Working with Dr. Richard Tygan, you must hire or rescue scientists. During your missions as you kill new aliens or discover alien intel caches, or various other items, you'd take them back to your ship to the butcher Dr. Tygan. In the ship he'd poke, prod, and dissect the aliens hoping to gain a little more knowledge, such as better weapons, armor, or utility items.  Engineering In Engineer you find&nbsp;Chief Engineer Lily Shen, daughter of and prodigy&nbsp;to the now-deceased Dr. Raymond Shen. Here she helps you build the items Tygan has researched, building plasma rifles and gas gernades. Additionally, her team works on the avenger, clearing debris and rebuilding rooms with facilities that give you boosts such as the Guerilla Tactics School, allowing you to expand the number of&nbsp;&nbsp;soldiers you can bring to a mission.  Aliens Firaxis has brought back some of the same aliens as before including Mutons, Berserkers, Sectoids, and a few others. However, each one is a little different, and you explore these differences in the autotopsys. You find out for example that the thin men from XCOM Enemy Unknown were actually a Viper race. Having successfully taken over the world, thin men are no longer needed, and they can finally take their true forms. Faceless are now the infiltration unit Clay Face looking creatures that somehow morph from inconspicuous looking civilians.  They're joined by Codex (data driven brains that teleport around the map), a cadre of Advent troopers (Troopers, officers,stun lancers, and shield bearers), and the biologically tinkered with aliens (Viper, Mutons, Chryssalids, Archons, and Andromedon).&nbsp; Firaxis does a fairly good job of introducing new threats, and pacing out their introduction so you never feel like your bored of the aliens, giving each unique attributes that offer a challenge to fighting them.  Soldier Classes XCOM2 offers you a number of classes including Ranger (Shotguns and Melee), Grenadier (Big weapons and Grenade Laucnhers), Specialist (Standard Weapons and Robots), Sharpshooter (Snipers), and Spark (if you got the DLC, it's a robot). Each class has about 6-7 unique abilities you can choose as the soldier gains rank (which they earn through killing things).  Gameplay Once deployed on a mission, you direct your soldiers around a map, hiding behind cover, and darting between trees and cars, trying to flank enemies and increase hit percentages against your opponents. The map is covered in a fog of war, and you always have to be careful, because once you are no longer concealed, uncovering enemies from the fog of war results in them seeing you, taking cover, and waiting until it's the alien's turn to gun you down. This helps lend to the strategy, as your always making sure to fight in zones, finishing off a group of aliens before proceeding forward so you don't end up fighting against 9 different aliens. Each soldier has (for the most part) two actions, with firing your main weapon generally ending your turn.",

They spank you while you are in the middle of a mission, then they leg it through a portal, only to return another time to slap you around some more. Rinse and repeat until you eventually kill them, which then allows you to research them to get new armour etc. I personally found this just added frustration to an already difficult game.  All in all however, the base game is definitely worth getting.   9/10",

            "review_text": "Didn't have a crash once, saw no glitches, other than the delays in turns, which a mod fixed like day 4,   Customization is insanely awesome, i was a person who believed it would add nothing to the game. I was totally wrong, the introduction of the character pool, which allows you to create soldiers and then import them to your game or show up as rookie recruits is amazing.   The game is an improvement on the previous xcom games in LITERALLY ALL WAYS.   The base building lets you have freedom and choice now, no more limitations such as forced to build Uplinks asap.   The new enemy variation is astounding, new enemies show up constantly keeping you on your toes, constantly wondering what the game may throw at you next.   The Viper enemies are probablly the worst alien to see, they take whatever plan you had and make you throw it out the window quickly so you can try to come up with a way to save your soldiers. (they do pathetic dmg though hardly a threat on their own)  The loot dropping mechanics and weapon upgrade system, are awesome, really giving you the feeling that you are working with what resources you are given, replacing Meld, with the detonating loot. BRILLIANT.   The story was quite thin in Enemy unknown but it served its purpose, the story here is more fleshed out, and you could tell they wanted to give you a good reason to push throught the trials, to save humanity from the Avatar project.   The Woudned system works differently you can have lightly wounded, wounded, or gravely wounded soldiers. If someone is gravely wounded they are healing for around 15 in game days, and if the aliens retaliate with your best troops wounded it can seem terrifying. (still beatable) This new system teaches you to be safe with your soldiers, sometimes causing you to be too safe and screw up evacuation missions, but thats what Xcom2 is about.    The Classes have been given much more attention, both trees are very appealing in their own ways and both are viable in every class.  Psionic troopers are available earlier in the game!!!!! However they are only available early if you take the sacrifices of not building your Guerilla building, or your workshop. You can take a chance at fighting the aliens with only 4 troops, or have your 6 troops, but be behind on your psionics research and training.  Psionic troopers take FOREVER TO TRAIN (literally around 2 MONTHS in game time. But that is to have a completly trained soldier, with literally all psionic abilities. However this is not a negative, they become precious troops, whom will actually force you to play the game better, and that is only because of the new injury system, without it they would just feel like overpowered troops with no downside.   The new 'failure state' comes when you allow the Aliens' Avatar project to go unchecked, you were either busy training psi soldiers (like me in my first game) or busy trying to get a bunch of supplies. This failure state is far more satisfying than the countries leaving the Xcom project. You feel like you actually have a tangible thing to fight against rather than just HOPING that the next Abduction mission does't happen to your highest panic countries. . If you fail, it was your fault. not just because rng decided to make it so.  TLDR  -An improvment in all ways over previous xcom games,  -EXTREMELY varied enemy pool. -Varied customization. -Sticks to the solid gameplay Enemy unknown made us all love -Concealment is super satisfying and getting the jump on aliens is glorious.  -Weapon upgrade system helps add more flavor to your already flavorful troops -Base building is way less constrictive, and because of this actually leads to more choices, and therefore more varied replays of the game. -Story is given more love -Classes are now quite balanced giving you more choice when you rank up.  -Mod Support on Day 1, that basically fixed anything the dev's didn't think of, or didn't have time for.",

The game loves to force your hand, apparent from the ticking fail-state clock at the top of the map. You can delay it, but you can't put it off forever. Timed missions are abundant, and taking things safe and slow isn't always an option.   That being said, the game is still lots of fun, and having all of these things stacked agains you makes the reward feel so much sweeter.   The game has some marked improvements over EU: Engineering is done a lot better, the concealment system is nice, albiet lacking, and equipment management is well, manageable.  The game does have a few technical issues, though.  I've experianced some minor animation glitches/bugs, but nothing game breaking. Load times can be sort of long (anywhere from 20 seconds to a full minute, though I installed this to my HDD) and optimization is not the best. I've experienced some rather notable frame chugging during the pre-mission loading screens, and in areas that have a lot of fire/smoke, though lowering shadow detail helped with the latter. Frame-rate on high settings is not entirely consistant on my 2gb GTX 960/ FX 8370 &amp; 16gb RAM, but it is by no means unplayable- though I've seen people with significantly more powerful systems than mine complaining about unplayable frame-rates, even on the lowest settings, so the game seems to be inconsitant.  I've not had the game crash/move into unplayable territory, but I've witnessed a significant number of people note this- so much so that I'd suggest you keep it in mind, though some of these people might be overdramatizing the issue, I would not write it off entirely.  Overall, the game is challenging and fun, and (At least for me) works. Buy it if you like stressing over 98% hit chances missing and leaving your ranger exposed without cover- because obviously your life wasn't already stressful enough.",

XCOM EU and EW are only slightly better in my opinion and that is for the few things I don't like about this game. The game feels similar to EU while simultaneously bringing a lot of new and interesting ideas to the table to keep the concept fairly fresh. Now on to the few things I don't enjoy about the game. First is the performance of the game. I have a pretty good computer that can run most games at max settings at around 60 fps (depending on the game), but this game is the first game to really give my computer a hard time. I constantly have stutters and extremely long load times. fps is around 40 or so. It isn't game breaking but it is very annoying to say the least. The second thing is how a good amount of the missions are done. Remember those bomb missions in EU that were really annoying? That is what, I'd say 50% of the game is. Now hold up a bit. While these still make the game annoying, Firaxis has compensated with making the maps more fluid in terms of being able to move faster and are generally stream lined. I think the enemies are more aggresive leading to faster battles but I'm not entirely sure if they are. Also, some people say they have a lot of bugs in this game, other than the, what I call, 'XCOM bugs' where ragdolls glitch and you're guys occasionally get a bit glitchy looking, there aren't any bugs that I've experienced.

            "review_text": "I give the game a reluctant recommendation because I don't think it's very good right now, but could be with some serious patching.  In a lot of ways the game has improved upon it's predecessor, especially in the strategic elements. There's a little more busy work so that you're not just waiting around between missions.  Squad customization is really nice. You can create troops from the main menu, that can then be implimented into the game later. Or if you have a trooper that you end up really like, you can alternatively export them and use them in later playthroughs. You can create back stories, tweak their personalities, and give them some character. It's all cosmetic, but it's really a huge boost to one of the things that's been most appealing about the franchise, so I consider that a huge plus. If you're really into that sort of thing there's enough here to keep you busy for awhile. And who knows what modders will be adding to that.  The tactical game is improved, but in many ways unchanged from XCOM: EU. Like many, the biggest gripe I have is with the frequency of timed missions, and how short they are. I've always played X-Com games at a fairly slow pace, and by comparrison this game feels like it's always in a rush (this applies to the strategic side as well).   This actually hampers one of the big changes with the tactical game and that's the ability to start out in stealth and set up ambushes. You really don't get many turns to do this, which kind of defeats the purpose of an ambush. Thus, while it does factor in to how you start an engagement, it really feels like a gimmick because you're almost better off just going in guns blazing. I don't mind the fact that the game puts you 'on the clock'. I just don't like the frequency, and how short that clock is. I don't have A.D.H.D. I like to take my time. An option to tweak the length of these timed missions would have made a world of difference.  While the game was made with the PC in mind, it still feels like it was designed to be played on a console. Considering this reboot franchise has almost 20 years of tech improvements over the original franchise, it's a shame that the game is still so... light.   I was really hoping there would be more strategic enhancements to make you feel like you're really fighting a revolution across the entire planet. The game isn't bad as it is. I just felt like they could have done a whole lot more without having to deal with the limitations of a console's interface and controls.   Thus, like EU, it's a good X-Com game, but it still falls short of what it could really be.  And of course there's the performance issues. These will likely be resolved, but it does seem like a pretty glaring problem.",

For those who don’t know it’s a strategy game with elements of RPG squad building and base/resource management, set in a time where aliens rule the world “helping” humans find true enlightenment through advanced technology. This all changes when the XCOM; EU’s old commander (you) is found and brought back into service to lead a rebellion against the alien rulers (the Elders).  The Pros; Nice and good story with nice cut scenes and excellent voice acting. You have a mobile base that can move around based on your current mission needs. The aliens are chasing you, they have more resources and soldiers compared to your limited resources and manpower (each soldier counts). Random maps (finally!) that makes each map different. Lots of different missions (with some similarities but at least it adds an element of difference), from save/capture the VIP, kill all the aliens, defend your ship from attack. Lots of tactical choices based on your soldiers and their abilities, nice little elements such as weapon modification. A brilliant soldier customisation tool making you even more attached to them. When you get it a nice psi system which allows you to quickly field powerful psionic’s in battle. Each map has some serious detail with everything being destroyable.  The Cons; Some minor camera glitches (not a big issue) but can cause problems when trying to click on a button behind a wall. A serious monster memory hugger (unless you have another monster graphics card and processor that can deal with it). Some issues with line of sight and melee attacks going through walls, shooting through walls with a pistol and other annoying minor combat issues. A none random element, I would find some attacks missing on 80% and other hitting with a critical on a 20%. I only discovered towards the end of the game that the game uses a 'pre-generated' set of rolls over the course of a fight, as each attack is taken, it checks against the list, ticks off a number, and moves to the next. Some may find this a better system to avoid re-saving cheat but I found it a struggle.

The same problem as in XCOM (2012): in tactical mode it's often unclear if there is a clear line of shot or there isn't. Sometimes it's obvious that a sniper can't hit the enemy running at him, but the game considers that everything is ok and the sniper fires at the wall point blank and the enemy gets hit.  2. Animations, camera angles and cutscenes. Again, a sniper gets aggroed by the wall, sticks his rifle through it and kills someone, but I can't see whom cause the only thing I can see at this moment is the texture of the sniper's back being shown closeup. In the middle of a mission a cutscene starts and the player sees the smoking pipes of some facility. After this, it's natural to wait for a new task or for new enemies to appear, but nothing happens. What did the developer want to tell us?  3.RNG and probability calculations (especially during hacking keeping in mind how big the achieved advantage or disadvantage can be). In short, I would make the calculation system even better: in the beginning of every mission I would give a choice between two buttons and a random number generated would decide if the mission is accomplished ('you got two scientists and a bunch of materials') or failed ('the game is triple as hard now you've failed'). It's clear that the developers wanted to apply this system but considered it too innovative. 40% of success sometimes mean that 19 attempts out of 20 will be unsuccesful.  4. It's also obvious that all these four years the developers tried hard to make the game look the same as XCOM (2012) and require four times more resources. This goal is achieved in general: the graphics got a little better, but I was playing XCOM (2012) with GTX 560Ti and now I'm playing XCOM 2 with GTX 970 but it seems vice versa.  5. Other minor bugs and flaws- but they are really many: saved games are glitched (the soldier sees the enemy, I save the game, I load the game, the enemy is not visible anymore), confusing use of mouse buttons (some actions are launched by the left mouse button and some with the right), uninformativeness and inconvenience of some menus (why can't I see how many elerium cores would remain after I produce something from the menu right before the start of the mission?)  **********************************************************  Очередная неплохая игра с замечательными идеями, сюжетом, работой дизайнеров и т.д., испорченная неумелыми программистами (да, From Software, я сейчас смотрю на вас).  1. Та же проблема, что и в XCOM (2012): в тактическом режиме часто непонятно, когда есть прямая линия видимости между бойцом и противником, а когда нет. Иногда очевидно, что снайпер никак не может поразить бегущего на него противника, но игра считает, что все нормально и снайпер стреляет в упор в стену, поражая при этом противника.  2. Анимации, ракурсы и катсцены. Опять же, снайпер, который в режиме наблюдения сагрился на стену, просунул сквозь нее винтовку и кого-то убил, но мы не видим, кого, потому что в это время нам показывают текстуру его спины крупным планом. Посреди миссии вдруг начинается катсцена, которая показывает игроку дымящие трубы завода. Естественно после этого ждать новую задачу или появления противников, но ни того, ни другого нету. Что нам хотел сказать разработчик?  3. RNG и расчет вероятностей (особенно во время взлома, учитывая, какое большое преимущество он может давать или каким оглушительным может быть провал). Если вкратце, я бы еще чуть-чуть улучшил имеющуюся систему: в начале миссии я бы предлагал игроку нажать на кнопку, вычислял бы случайное число и, отталикаваясь от него, сразу решал бы, пройдена миссия ('вы получили двух ученых и вагон ресурсов') или провалена ('игра стала втрое сложнее после провала'). Очевидно, что разработчики хотели ввести именно такой принцип, но сочли его слишком инновационным. 40% успеха иногда означают, что 19 попыток из 20 не будут успешными.  4. Также мне кажется очевидным, что эти четыре года разработчики бились над вопросом, как сделать игру выглядящей так же, как XCOM (2012), но при этом требующей вчетверо больше ресурсов. Этой цели разработчики в целом достигли: графика стала чуть лучше, но в XCOM я играл с GTX 560Ti, а в XCOM 2 играю с GTX 970, но кажется, что наоборот.  5. Другие мелкие баги и недочеты - но их реально много: глючные сохранения (боец видит противника, сохраняешь игру, загружаешь - уже почему-то перестал видеть), неразбериха с правой и левой кнопками мыши (некоторые действия надо инициировать левой кнопкой, некоторые - правой), неинформативность и неудобство многих меню (почему когда я произвожу какую-то вещь прямо перед миссией, я не могу посмотреть, сколько останется ядер элерия на складе после производства?)",

            "review_text": "Xccom 2 has incredible graphics thanks to the unreal world builder and great artistic work by those who deserve credit. That is the only good thing I have to say about Xcom 2.  So far in my commander difficulty game I have not enjoyed any of it. Every single mission is the same. You are on rails the entire game. Every map is your squad walking straight across the map, no exploration, you walk directly from point a to point b, every single time. No exploration, you know without question where the enemies are. It's not tactical at all. Every mission has the same enemies and the same ammount of them. Nothing fun about this game and to top that off the dialog is unforgivable. Jake solomon is hands down the worst thing that has ever happened to Xcom. Constant misuse of words in dialog, with no intelligent flow from subject to subject. Just as if Sarah Palin wrote the scripts and then they paid some voice over to read each word of the script. However they only record each word one at a time and paste all the words together so you get the MOST akward dialog at times where you know for a fact that the sentence was spliced together by seperate audio clips. So lazy for a 60dollar game especially a well established game company thats been in business for years, you would expect much more than this.  A lot of people complain about performance, I have no issues with performance, but I must note that at times enemy death can take upto 10 seconds. You're just sitting waiting, the death only took 2 of the 10 seconds but you just sit there waiting for the game. It might seem like lag but you can see the soldiers idle animations and frame rate isn't dropped or locked at all. Music mouse ect work just fine but it's as though there is wait time programmed into so much of the animation sequences that the game plays like a poker game where one person is in the other room ALL THE TIME.  The worst part about this game is that it's only an intellectual property license which means you can't get a refund for the game and you can't take a literal ♥♥♥♥ on it. Because there are only two things that this game would be good for, pooping on it, and returning it for a refund.",

            "review_text": "X-Com 2 Simply put, it is a turn based strategy game set with Invading Aliens. Your a commander of the eponymous military organization. You take over a mobile ship sending your forces out in missions to complete to gain certain aspects of the game that you can use to make weapons, research advancements, and new technologies, You can recruit and build certain facilities all within a story based format. It is a vast improvement to X-com with beautifully done cut scenes and story action sequences. A must have for strategy lovers. However, it has some solid pros and cons to look over before buying if your unfamiliar with the previous incarnations, which you don't need to play. PROS A: Vastly improved Real Engine 3.5 allows for great cut scenes within the actual battles, so you see terrific end moves to your actions. Wonderful story cut scenes. B: With the Workshop, you can custom everything from weapons to looks, you can make them into super hero costumes, classic characters or your own mad creations. C: new concealment system can help you stall but not make much a difference. Still cool to have  D: Fun difficulty settings and wonderful modding tools E: I am sure more expansions will continue to enhance the game story and levels down the road. CONS A: A serious one is your computer compatibility. You must look at the requirements, better the machine better output, but the game has been plagued with failing files and some hiccups. However, matching the minimum requiremnets will be risky. Poor performance on systems is an issue I do think they will get a handle on. B: The fact that you must play the game in a progressive format like the first few games, does not allow you to build and enjoy your creations for long endeavors. It seems like a waste for example It will not allow to deviate long from moving forward with the story. Sort of like playing RISK wanting to build up, when all you have to do is complete the story itself to get to the end result C: It is confined by the old game battle mechanics. The Workshop mods help with adding abilities, but still restrict you to past mechanics D: Careful of the DLC releases, some good, some a waste. E: Have to have your men on Overlook all the time and positioning can be frustrating and you will miss a lot. OVERALL In my honest accessment, XCOM2 is a great game that as I said a must have for strategy lovers. Wait till for a weekend sales fest before buying but make sure your system can handle it. You can try X-COM enemy within first if your not sure. Go to the workshop to watch others play and videos and then decide if it is for you. This game has more to like than dislike, but be clear that I did stay objectively in adding those cons. XCOM2 is fun, will keep you engaged. I give this a positive for the entire game scope, but not without flaws. RATE 3.5 out of 5 stars.",

The DLC's aren't as good as Enemy Within, but having the whole set DOES add a lot to the game.  Character creation and replayability are easily the games best points. It does still have occasional bugs, but much like the Elder Scrolls games they don't get in the way of the experience- even if we would rather see them patched out.  Overall a must have for XCOM fans, a solid buy for people who like strategy/tactics games, and worth looking into if you just like the idea of a very customisable alien invasion simulation.

XCOM2 does shine in a few areas, but overall comes across as trying far too hard to recreate the difficulty of the original XCOM series, only to feel forced and disingenuous in doing so.   It confuses the player with a flaky interface, it's unpredictable with erratic visibility mechanics, and generally feels wildly inconsistent when it comes to its own in-game rules. I'm not against difficult games, but XCOM2 goes well beyond believability and enjoyability in order to create situations that simply require multiple attempts to get right. The resulting game experience is one where you feel like you're fighting against the developers instead of the in-game enemy.  Edit: I said at the beginning that this game shines in some areas, and it deserves to have those pointed out. Like XCOM (both the original and the new remake), XCOM2 creates some amazing, fist-pumping moments of joy and awesomeness. The graphics are generally great, the storyline is interesting and compelling, and the core game mechanics are solid and just plain fun.   So it's quite frustrating that there these moments of inconsistency, like mentioned above, that force me to reload every other turn. I get that XCOM should be a brutal game, but that brutality should come from in-game experiences within the player's expectations, not from an interface glitch, broken line of sight on grenade launchers, or the fact that I can't tell if my character can shoot from a particular position before moving him/her there.  Clarified recommendation: I recommed it, but only if you're ready for a very frustrating experience.",

I go to the Blood Bowl 2 page and look at the reviews and so many people claim to dislike the game due to it's reliance on dice rolls and rng, yet when I come to the X-Com 2 reviews I see it get praised although it too relies heavily on dice rolls and rng..  Percentages is the name of the game, the higher the better obviously. But just as in Blood Bowl, it's about positioning. This game is a chess match through and through, but do not be surprised if you are positioned to take that valued 'Queen' on an 80% roll and FAIL it.  The game is very good in that it endlessly generates new situations to confront you and your resistance force. It has that RPG flavor that gives you a sense of accomplishment as well as direction.   But make no mistake, this game is BRUTAL. In the same vein as say, the Darkest Dungeon, you can and more than likely will lose many soldiers at the blink of an eye while the world just watches. However I think the difficulty dictates the longevity, as it was back in the old era of video games. If you haven't completed a single campaign, then the game is not over.",

Deep tactical exploration with an RNG-twist, that sometimes let you bite your keyboard.   Note: Because I hate the timers, I played almost my whole playthrough with the 'Disable Timers'-mod found in the workshop. That was maybe the most negative point about this game: almost every mission has a damn timer running up, some missions were almost impossible without save game scumming.   Also, the performance for a PC-exclusive title is horrendous. Although my machine is way above the recomended specs, I needed to tune down on shadows and AA to shorten the loading screens and keep the stuttering to a minimum. I seriously hope this will get fixed soon.  Otherwise maybe already my game of 2016. Oh, the fun you can have with mind control and battle hacking.   You see this Sektopod over there?

Not only are these missions timed, cutting your fun factor down, the whole campaign has a countdown clock that if not delt with, will result in a total campaign wipe. To top it off you'll spend countless hours of screaming at your screen due to the fact that your soldiers really, really suck and the aliens are spot on with their shots, every time. I simply don't understand how this game has such high status and reviews with its current meta and overall performance issues and bugs.

Slow transitions from one scene to the next Story line advances way to fast, you seldom have a chance to finish a scan or research anything. In every mission you are out numbered, out classed, and your troops cant hit anything. Troops take too long to heal, if someone gets wounded you may not get to use them for 24 days, which is an eternity in this game. If you love having your troops mind controlled from the second mission and on, and love finally after firing your entire squad at one guy (even though they all had an 80% chance to hit him) and finally killing him to have to kill him again because he got reanimanted and is now even tougher than he was while he was alive, then this game is for you. You only have a very limited time to try to get 'loot' that is dropped by a random guy that you had to spend all your actions to kill drops If you skip a mission knowing your troops aren't up to it the game really hoses you,   The sad thing I had hope for this game but the difficulty of the tactical scenes and the complete chaos of the meta game puts it outside the skill set of this causal player, sure some people will like the challenge, but I find it completely unmanagable. For the record I beat the orginal xcom, I beat the 2012 xcom so I am not a fool, this game is just crap. I don't want a game to just roll over for me, but reasonably acheivable would be nice.

I ran through on Iron Man in XCOM a few times, but this game could very well make that impossible. Currently it is a matter of Saviing often and early! Combat can be especially challenging as there is no way to know just which positions are going to trigger the next set of enemies. Fighting three (3) aliens with four (4) of your marines is totally doable, trigger the next alien reinforcements early and you are facing six (6) to your four (4); this will yield either one or more injured or dead in your party making the mission an out right mess.  On missions without time limits it is best to move cautiously and use overwatch fregrently; there is nothing more exciting to watch than your troopers ripping through a heavily armored enemy as the four of them shredd the behemouth with reaction fire.  Misssions with time limits... move far and fast in the early turns so as to get closer to the objective before the enemy is ready. These missions are the most dangerous as you can not wait for the enemy to make mistakes and must charge into the breach to see what will happen. Rangers excel at this and I like ot keep two (2) in my squad. Moving them up half way will often trigger an enemy response. Soften them up with heavy weapons and your sniper followed by two ninja ranger slash attacks. Three enemies up... three enemies down.  Overall the graphics are superior to the earlierr version and the new and improved enemies have been challenging at times on 'vetran'; God knows what the next level of difficulty will bring!  So saddle up ladies and gentlemen and be ready for some truly excellent tactical combat!",

Basically, your guys are American or English if you want them to speak English in game (don't even bother with the terrible Australian and UK 4 'Irish' accent).  Gameplay-wise, it's not super different to XCOM: EU. The game starts out fine. Tier 2 is the most frustrating, I actually got bored and put the game down for a while. Tier 3 is where the game really comes into its own.",

            "review_text": "I'm loving it, it improves nicely on the first XCOM (not the original one, haven't played it).  The fact that many missions have some sort of time pressure will irritate some (c.f. some reviews. CLARIFICATION: you can take as long as you want to make your moves, the only limit is the number of turns you get.). Be aware that there's already mods that increase the turn limit or get rid of it completely, so if it's really not your thing, you can easily play the game differently. But I think the frequent time pressure is great and it improves the game. Here's why:  -having to manage time as a resource IS strategic, contrary to some opinions. While it does remove the option to take it absolutely slow and cautious, so far, I've found there's plenty of wiggle room and making a mad dash for the objective is NOT your only option.  -time pressure is thematically very coherent with the game's premise of being resistance fighters. Not having it would create ludo-narrative dissonance.  -what the turn limit basically does is force you to give up the most effective XCOM: EU play-style, which is take it super slow, only activate one bunch of enemies at a time, spam overwatch and reload after each encounter. Unless you didn't care about winning, XCOM forced you to play like that. There were no rewards for finishing early, afaik (there were some rewards for taking risks in the expansion, though). Favouring such a slow playstyle is a bit like wasting the player's time.  -time pressure lets you experience a different, thrilling playstyle the same way playing without saves (ironman mode, iirc) helps you enjoy the game in a different way that you probably wouldn't, with saves enabled. Unless you're super disciplined, you know you end up reloading when your favorite soldier dies. Same goes for taking yet another turn, reload- and overwatch-spamming.  MISC COOL STUFF: -A memorial for your soldiers with the option to write them an epitaph. So far, my only casualty's reads: 'Whatshername will not be forgotten.'  -Enemy Reinforcements: (not sure, if these also happened in XCOM: EU). It totally fits the scenario and it's very exciting to see a dropship come in and worry about what it might bring, as well as very satisfying to set up an ambush for them and wipe them when their feet touch the ground.  FINAL THOUGHTS: If you liked XCOM:EU, you'll love this one. Give it a try as it is, and if you absolutely must play ultra-slow, simply use a mod.",

You would have to go a long way to beat it and I have to say that Firaxis have gone so far past that mark that you will need the hubble telescope.  Its visually stunning and the gameplay still captures what is all good and great about Xcom games. I have played the first 4 or 5 missions and Im blown away. I have been looking forward to this game for months and im not dissapointed. Shame I have work in the morning and have to sleep with the 11pm launch and all.  Still a few first day bugs which im sure will be ironed out. These relate to cutscenes and mainly experianced with the launch of the skyranger for missions. It goes out of synch but this is a minor annoyance. The soldiers moving animations can also seem a little jumpy at times but not so much that i care so far  Soldier customisations are great and I spent an hour or so messing with my guys and girls some fun looks but also some really cool ones too. Combat is still as good as ever but one little niggle is the cutscene of the soldiers face everytime they shoot. In Xcom you only saw this on a kill so everytime seems excessive but the gun animation and sounds are good. Hacking for in mission power ups is a nice touch as is the soldier panic. When a soldier panics he can randomly run off and take a shot which actually finished a mission for me :) Would like to be able to select my own soldier classes on promotion though as that was great in LW but we will see how this goes.Research looks varied and interesting and I like I can pick up gear from drops of dead enemies rpg style.  All in all this was worth the wait and I would highly recommend it to anyone with a passing interest in turn based comabt mecahincs. Sigh I can see another 500+ hours of my life dissapearing 10/10",

            "review_text": "First impressions after just a couple of hours of play: very similar to the previous offering in mechanics and play, though the story line seems more interesting. Weapons upgrades are a new, and kind of cool, feature (you can add laser sights, high capacity mags, autoloaders, etc., to individual weapons). There seems to be a similar upgrade option for individual soldiers ('PCS' attachments), but I haven't figured out how to use them yet. If you're into dressing up your squad, there are more uniforms, face paint options and color options than before. There's a split economic system--intel and supplies--not yet sure of the implications.  Most missions are on a pretty tight timer, that requires you to move quite quickly. This is mitigated somewhat by the interesting 'concealed' mechanism (and by one character class, the Ranger, that can remain concealed after the enemy alerts to your presence). The upshot is that you'll leave a lot more enemies alive and just run past them to complete your mission. This makes for a somewhat different flavor than the 'search and destroy' missions from Enemy Unknown, but I don't find it disturbing as do some other reviewers. It just requires a different tactical approach.  Now, the bad: the cut scenes are fun once, but you can't skip past them, so if you end up going back to an old save or playing a second time through, they're just obnoxiously repetitive. Likewise, if you need to go back and check out your current objectives, you've got to watch them scroll excruciatingly slowly down a screen that you don't have a scroll bar for. That's just annoying. The load screens that come up as you're going to and from missions are interminable--do they really have to be so long?  This could have been a much better game if the designers hadn't decided to make you watch their cool cut scenes whether you wanted to or not. Instead, it rapidly becomes annoying as you wait for your helpers to ramble through speeches you've already heard. This limits the replay value tremendously.  4 out of 10. Should be a 7. Could be a 9. But the designers like wasting your time, so 4.   UPDATE: Having played through the game, I'm even more disappointed with the time-wasting nonsense I discuss above. The cut-scenes last waaaaay too long (like up to 2 minutes before and after every mission--I've got time to get up, get a beer and come back, only to find my troopers still flying around in the cut-scene. This isn't loading time; when I load a saved game it finishes in about 10 seconds. It's just bloody-minded time wasting.) Also, the dramatic cut scenes for various mission points can't be skipped. Some of them go on and on. This really limits replay value.  Lots of people have complained that the game is too tough. I don't agree. The tactics are a bit different from the prior game--using concealment (and rangers who stay concealed after the fighting starts) is a bit tricky, but once you figure it out the aliens are still pretty easy to drop. The mission clocks are rarely too tight, and the Avatar Project progress is easy to stall. Overall, the game would be a worthy successor to and improvement on its predecessor, but the annoying, unescapable, time-wasting cut-scenes just kill it.",

Seeing as the developers is on a MASSIVE bann spree on everyone who says a remotely negative thing about the game. So far my experience has been this.  Negatives: The campain is timed and thus rush you on -everything-. Every mission is basicly a timer mission. Some missions are so badly optomized its forcing you to kill off 3/4 of your team to let your one high level surrive. That'd normaly be awesoem but when it does that on many missions, it becomes a bother. Since the campaign is a timer rush you are forced to rush through your developments and you need to spend resources on soldiers because someone thought it'd be an amazing idea to put a wounded state on 20 days + on every soldier that recieve just a single bar of damage, so you are forced to toss aside MUCH needed upgrades and weapon researches in order to be able to have enough manpower to even DO missions due to the so limited money you have. Bugs, glitches and bugs -everywhere!- I have been shot by enemies far off and down a mountain shooting straight through the mountain at me. Even sniping me through a house. The enemies HP bars are RIDICILOUSLY big. And your weapons have the worst accurecy i've ever seen. They stand right point blank infront of you, and you have a 31% chance of hitting..? WITH A SHOTGUN!? There is so many more neggatives really but i can't be arsed to note all of them down, it'd take an entire page.  POSSITIVES: The game is GORGOUS, amazing randomized levels and awesome grapics and animations. Weapons and armor is aloooot better in the game now, given that when you make 1 armor. it becomes avaible to all soldiers. Not just one soldier like in Xcom 1.  Good story, the story of the game keeps your interest peeked as you progress and it has some nice cinematics. The Commander. You are once again back in action with some of the old team and some new with ties to the old team, its good to be back! Enemy variations theres quite alot of this time and they are all unique and interesting in ther own manner. Besedes the lancer, he has infinite movement range and just pass through your people like nothing, thats BS he needs fixing or removal.  Overall for the near ten hours i've played this game. It feels like a half-arsed rushed product which they just ended up not caring about in the end and some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dev found it a hillarious idea to time every mission and EVEN the campaign.

It then proceeds to run some more...and then clone itself. There are now two half-health codexes. Oh, it also uses a Psi ability that causes weapons to be disabled, disabling my Ranger's and Grenadier's primary weapon.   I run the ranger to a better spot. I try to grenade one of the codexes with the Grenadier...but it has 4 health...and the grenadier only hit for 3. My Sharpshooter goes for a pistol shot and does 1 damage to the original Codex. The Specialist takes shoots the original Codex, bringing it down to 1 health.   Remember that Psi-ability I talked about earlier? The one that disabled the Primary weapons of my Ranger and Grenadier? My Grenadier is still standing in it. It promptly explodes, killing my Grenadier instantly. I stared at the screen for a second in disbelief...but I knew the mission wasn't over yet. The two Codexes teleport onto a nearby roof...which my Sharpshooter happens to be standing on. One of them empties its weapon into my Sharpshooter's back, critting. My Sharpshooter goes down, wounded.   I get the specialist and the Ranger within supporting range but outside the range of that Psi-ability.  The Codexes come down, one bringing my Specialist down to half health with a single shot.   My Specialist shoots the one on 1 health, killing it, and my Ranger kills the other with a sword attack.   I check to see if the Grenadier is still alive, but he wasn't. I sent my Specialist to the roof to see if the Sharpshooter was still alive...and she was. My Specialist slung the Sharpshooter over her back and went back to the Ranger, who was on Overwatch. No aliens appear.  We move into the final building, the one with the mission objective.   An ADVENT mech and trooper, easily dispatched with Combat Protocol. I move in and take the vial with no more resistance.  RED FLARES, so an ADVENT dropship is going to arrive. I pur my Ranger by the window and put her on overwatch. My Specialist takes cover and sets down her wounded comrade.   On the alien turn...things take a TURN for the worse. So PUNNY. A Stun Lancer, an Officer, and a Trooper from the Dropship...and a Sectoid and two more troopers trigger from the roof...and three more ADVENT outside the room. My Ranger misses her Overwatch.   The Ranger kills the Officer, and my Specialist shoots a Trooper.  But it's not enough.  The Sectoid drops down and crits the Ranger, killing her instantly. ADVENT troopers move in and surround my Specialist, giving her no unflanked cover options. She kills an ADVENT Trooper...and then the rest of them open up with Mag Rifles.   ---RIP--- My First Team You went unnamed because none of you made it past corporal May they rest in p̶e̶a̶c̶e̶ reloads.

Optimisation: Yes the game is badly optimised, but it doesn't really affect gameplay, maybe i'm more used to playing game on underpowered rigs but this didn't affect me at all, only had 2 crashes during my 45 hour playthough, though I do understand how this could annoy some people.  Difficulty: The game is noticably harder than Xcom EU/EW but that's a good thing, like KSP solving a hard problem gives you a sense of acomplishment that sticks with you.

Xcom 2, on one hand forces me to press forward as fast as possible, on the other hand confronts me with unit types that early on can easily kill of my units with little chance to react properly.

Although it says more about my skill than the game asI play more casually, I was expecting something around the same difficulty level as XCOM: EU/EW, this is not so at all.   Also, I do not enjoy how time sensitive the game is, most missions start with the clock running and endgame progresses faster than I can keep up or reset. I understand that this is designed so to creat tension, but timed missions isn't someonthing everyone enjoys.  Hence the cautious thumbs down, I think most people would enjoy the game, but if you are new to the series, are looking for basically more of the same XCOM, or play casually and don't really want to get in a punishing game after a long day at work, then this game is not for you.",

The game doesn't look as nice as XCOM: EU, it jumps forward from time to time, and has on a few occasions crashed on me. That said, this game is one of my favorites.  It is very clear that the devs took both the best features and worst flaws of XCOM: EU into consideration and made an effort to improve on them.     In response to the strange attachment that many developed to their prize soldiers, they have now made each soldier even more unique, adding more customization options, creating background stories, and making new recruits significantly more difficult to come by.   To force players to actually think, timers have been added to most missions. No longer can you just take the slow and steady route, keeping overwatch active on all your soldiers, every turn. It makes the game more challenging, but also considerably more interesting.    Both enemy and soldier builds have been reworked, mixing familiar mechanics with new abilities. The enemies feel more powerful, but so do your soldiers.   As of right now, my biggest complaint is with the world map. While I like being able to move the Avenger around, I'm not completely enamored with the new system of relays and contact regions. Being able to move, choose, or build new HQ locations would help with this.  All in all, this game is an improvement over XCOM: EU. While it might not run as well as you would like, the game itself is incredible. It both retains the best qualities of the previous game while improving and adding other elements. It is a bit expensive, but I don't at all regret my purchase.",

The designs and feel of this game are great.  All that being said there are some issues I ran into that should have been taken care of in Beta testing, but hopefully will be fixed later on. These issues include the ground being blown out from under a soldier, but the soldier stays airborn and unable to move.

            "review_text": "XCOM 2 feels like a much cleaner and refined game than XCOM Enemy Within. There finally is an actual reason for the limited resources that was so puzzling in the first XCOM game. XCOM 2 has you make choices about what you should pursue, without punishing you with rising panic levels in XCOM Enemy Within. This is done through a smartly designed map that allows the Avenger to move around to individual sites and scan for the materials or resources you are attempting to acquire. The map also works very well to give you a visual representation of your progress, as you make contact with the resistance in the different parts of the world. Ultimately, I found this screen and the method of presenting missions to you to be XCOM 2's biggest failing. Why do I have to make contact with the resistance of a region before taking on the story missions? I get that it's to slow the game down, but I was delayed by a huge amount of time between these missions in order to build the necessary buildings. What was also immensly frustrating was the amount of missions that were shoved in my face. The objectives quickly got repetetive, and it was incredibly aggravating to go from a challenging mission into having another 'crucial mission' given to me just two or three days after I got back from the last one. Honestly, does the Council want me to destroy the AVATAR project or rescue this one scientist? The time it takes soldiers to recover from wounds is painfully slow; even if they only took one hit the whole mission, they still spend 9-12 days recovering, which is 2-3 missions in XCOM 2's staggering speed of missions. I so rarely had a full squad of my best soldiers for one mission, and had to resort to stealthing several story missions with rookies on occaision, leading to me throwing away 3+ soldiers and killing maybe 2 aliens in a mission with 22. On one hand, it was pretty fun to sneak up to the objective, but it also was frustrating because I was missing out on the reason XCOM 2 is such a magnificent game: it's combat.  Thankfully, XCOM 2's combat is easily the best in the series, almost making up for the aggravating mission placement. The heavy, sniper, assault, and support classes have been replaced with the grenedier (think demo man from tf2, great for destroying cover), sharpshooter (skilled sniper that is also great with pistols and can do a devestating amount of damage to multiple enemies a turn), ranger (assault-esque reconnaisance unit that weilds an awesome sword and a shotgun that can do incredible damage at close range), and specialist (specialist replacement that can heal, revive, hack mechanical enemies, and provide bonus defense to an ally from range) classes. All these classes feel very unique and immensly fun to control and use their unique abilities. I especially enjoyed the ranger's slash ability, though rangers scale the worst out of any class in the game. The new enemy units are also brilliantly designed. In the first 8 hours of the campaign, XCOM 2 really delivered the feeling that XCOM is a shadow of what it once was. The aliens feel technologically superior and pack a serious punch. However, after the first weapons upgrade and armor upgrade the fights become much more even. While the AI does occaisionally make some seriously baffling mistakes, it is largely improved. I enjoyed the combat the most about XCOM 2, and seriously have very little ground to take a negative stance on anything. There were several circumstances (much more frequent than I would have liked), where everything goes wrong to no fault of you. I've had turns where all 6 of my soldiers have missed their 70%+ chance shots or overwatches on the following turn, and several of them have wound up dead and most of the others heavily wounded. This happened a little too often for my liking, not enough to really complain about, but persistant enough to remember.   Overall, XCOM 2 is an amazing game that perfects the satisfying combat of the XCOM franchise. The combat is crisp and the action cam makes your heart leap at every great hit and plummet with every enemy strike. If it wasn't for the crippling soldier recovery times and short spacing between missions, XCOM 2 would be the best single play game I've ever played. I would give XCOM 2 an 8.5/10.",

No, it's not, in my opinion.  Let me explain. When they remade XCOM, Firaxis had to stick relatively close to the original template. Enemy Unknown/Within was a classic, and by a considerable margin my most played Steam game. With XCOM 2, they've attempted to put their own stamp on the franchise, by shifting it onto a guerilla campaign setting, and introducing the stealth mechanic in the tactical gameplay. If you put those aside however, you're still leveling up your troopers, researching new tech, carving up dead aliens, and building doohickeys for your people to take into battle.  My point is that it's more of the same. That's not a bad thing, mind you. It's just the difference between good and great, and XCOM 2 is 'only' a good game. I'm also not impressed by the technical state the game was released in, having had problems with stuttering and looooooooooooooooooooong load times. This will most likely be fixed in post-release patches; Firaxis are usually good about that.  Long story short: good game, but not great. I'll keep playing, and I do recommend it, but it's solid instead of amazing.  EDIT (May 17th, 2016): It's disappointing that this game is still this glitchy this far after release, and especially disappointing that the new 'May patch' and Alien Hunters DLC have broken a number of people's (including my) games. Not up to the standards I expect from Firaxis. I still kinda-sorta recommend it, but a bit less than originally.  EDIT (August 10th, 2016): Okay, having finished another game with both the Alien Hunters and Shen's Last Gift DLCs, at least the game doesn't crash any more. It's still running unacceptably glitchy this far after release.  As for the DLCs, Alien Hunters was pretty neat for the weapons it gives, the armor options are kinda gross (don't like wearing the skins of my enemies) and the alien rulers are just annoying to fight because they drag the forward momentum of the midgame down to slooooooooooow.   Shen's Last Gift is okay: the SPARK class is a cool robot hybrid of Specialist and Grenadier, but the narrative mission is meh.  Overall, now that the game isn't BROKEN, I can recommend it a bit more, although I'm probably done playing for now. If it was less glitchy, I'd probably be moving towards the well over 300 hours that I accumulated on Enemy Unknown/Within, but as is, I don't want to fight the game any more.",

I know that it is part of the fun, but it could have been applied based on difficulty level selected for example. I'm looking forward to discover more things of this game. It has everything that a rogue organization needs: assassinations, hostage rescues, base building, roster selection, character pool, etc. etc. A very well rounded game. It is a rare jewel to be found nowdays to be honest. Highly recommended.",

Pros: -Fun 1v1 multiplayer with access to most units in the game -Good atmospheric music for the game -Fun variety of obstacles and challenges to deal with -Choice in what to take on, except when it tunnels you into popup missions -Base building lets you specialize and chose what you want -Great character customization -Unique game every time you play -Variety of maps and environments -About 75% play your way, which is good, but should be higher for a strategy game with this much potential -Good camera freedom to observe how you would want to -Satisfying combat -Builds good emotional connection to your party and crew  Cons: (Remember, these can all be changed as the game is relatively new) -Doesn't let you chose what to upgrade your recruits into -Multiplayer is so slow and full of delays -Multiplayer is poorly balanced, you are helpless in some situations while some units are absolute garbage -Spammy annoying popups stop you from scanning what you are trying to do -The turn enemies are introduced to you they get a reaction turn which can be pretty dumb in some cases -Many enemies have a gun which can charge up and do 4 damage to people in full cover, I lost my first squad member to 3 people doing this in one turn and killing my ranger which was BS -Random delays which ruin the game's pace which cannot be skipped on the map and some battles -TIMED MISSIONS ARE THE WORST THING TO PUT IN A STRATEGY GAME LIKE THIS, THEY RUIN IT. Some of them are reasonable, but others force you to charge in and die and can be entirely impossible from RNG. I took my best 6 [max squad size] squaddies with good equipment and variety and had to hack into information while fighting basically without spoiling opposition I can say was the hardest fight ive encountered so far, even though it was a spammy popup mission rather than a key plot objective. I dashed over with one turn to spare and it didnt let me use hack after the dash for whatever reason. There have been others times where I have barely made it, and even using specialists to hack at range is still very challenging at points. Either at least multiply the timer by 1.5 for every mission or take it out entirely. It cripples your ability to play how you want and be strategic. It should honestly be so that the timer only starts once you are revealed from concealment so you can adjust yourself properly from the spawn cluster you drop in  VERDICT: Don't be a turd, do not pirate this game, it is worth buying it for the multiplayer and so that they have money to use on improving the game Do not judge the game too harshly because it is new and has tons of potential Wait for a sale (summer sale most likely) if you are a cheapo Buy the game and take it slow by getting started and learning the ropes in a trial campaign before starting your real one, wait for patches to polish it up to how it should have been released. 7/10 Could easily be up to a 9/10 within the first patch if they improve the areas that need it",

Yes I admit before this game I saw no talent within myself for TBS games I was more of a spoiled 'run and gun' type with the end always in plain sight. This game ripped that run and gunner out of me and showed it to me as a personal flaw which allowed me to rethink what soldiers I would take into battle with me, what missions would best fit my needs at the moment and in the long war, where to position and more importantly WHO to position when and where with what items. It allowed me to question every tactical flank that led to the demise of my entire squad, so I continued with extreme caution knowing that the mission I was on needed to be dealt with in that exact manner.   I admit I'm not an expert of turn-based tactics and I don't claim to be, what I do claim to have is a developing understanding of how the game is meant to be played.  Everything you do in XCOM you are held accountable for, you may make a decision that would benifit you but has made others distrust you, A refugee camp may be under attack and you may decide that finishing a research project holding some valuable assets might be worth more in the long run. The decison and the consequences are yours.The name of the game is patience be perceptive and try to always be 100% sure before making any move.   I never beat XCOM Enemy Unknown but... Funny story, I actually started the game for my first time on IRON MAN MODE! So that being said, fair warning to all you newcomers if you pick this game up and a friend challenges you to beat this game on iron man mode, don't be too afeared to say that your still wet behind the ears OK? Even if the deal is too good to pass up, but hey I had nothing to lose ;P cept my pride.   So to sum up the game itself besides it being a marvel that TBS fans will play for an eternity. XCOM 2 has a lot to offer in the replayability department with many game difficulties to master, enough weapons, facilties, soldiers and abilities to research not to mention the aliens you kill will become researchable for kick-♥♥♥ toys to take with you on the field.

Yet, to those who have played XCOM before: it's all about the gameplay.   Gameplay-wise, especially with the excellent mods already in circulation, this is hands-down one of my new favorite games. It ensures replayability is almost endless, and keeps this game fun.   I'd recommend playing on Ironman; save-scumming isn't as fun. Also, after playing through once, don't hesitate to download a ton of the popular mods: they are awesome, and make this game feel fresh almost everytime I play.    So, in short: if you love XCOM, get this game. It's worth the full price. Definitely worth any sale prices.",

Its more or less Enemy Unknown/Enemy Within just ramped up to eleven. Overall lots of minor improvements and a ramp up in difficulty. Aliens are meaner and are way more likely to ruin your day but your soldiers in turn have some really OP abilities to compensate. When the game fires on all cylinders its incredibly fun. The ramped up customization and mods are a serious plus aswell. I also can confirm its longer than XCOM EU/EW and is overall better written/more cinematic.  If you didnt like EU/EW theres a good chance you wont like this unless you didnt like EU/EW for a very specific reason thats fixed here.  Some complaints, for starters it shares some of the same issues as EU/EW and its shame Firaxis hasnt really botherd to fix them. The game when I played it (and from what I can tell from the forums) has some technical issues. Some of them annoying others incredibley frustrating. If your tolerance for technical issues isnt very high, I would reccomend holdng off for abit maybe till the DLC comes out. Overall I dont like how chaotic the game feels either, the mission timers and how they throw missions at you constantly is just way too much to keep up with. Its also been streamlined in ways that take away from the experience more so then make it smoother and more engaging. Finally this is more of a personal issue but I feel as a PC exclusive the game plays it way too safe. They dont really shake up the formula in any meaningful way.

Timers also don't bug me, but you can take it away from the game with a single mod. And that let us with the other part of the bad reviews, performance/bugs. I only get bugs with some mods (long war mods, I'm looking at you). My performance in the other hand, is a bit low, but it runs very ok once I found (google again) how to optimize it and stuff, it runs on about 25 fps, it's not a real time game so I don't really need more then that to perform good on the game, but of course it would be nice to have more perfornamce. Also, keep in mind that I could get better performance, I just choose to get it looking better, since it does not bug me at 25 fps.

Temporizadores também não atrapalham tanto, é interessante como um desafio a mais, mas você pode tira-lo do jogo com um mod se não gostar. A outra parte dos comentários ruins, é quanto ao desempenho e bugs. Eu só tive erros com alguns mods (long war mods, estou olhando para você). Meu desempenho por outro lado lado, é um pouco baixo, mas funciona muito bem quando eu descobri (google novamente) como otimizá-lo e outras coisas, rodo em cerca de 25 fps, não é um jogo em tempo real, então eu realmente não precisa mais do que isso para performar bem no jogo, mas é claro que seria bom ter mais performance. Além disso, tenha em mente que eu poderia obter um desempenho melhor, eu escolhi ter um melhor gráfico, uma vez que vc não precisa muito mais que isso pra jogar bem.

The mission objectives and proceedural environments also have much more variety than before.  The story is still a little generic, but again an improvement in characters and world building. I'm not going to spoil the reveal at the end, but I literally fist pumped in anticipation of another sequel. Character customization is fluff, but it's also been greatly expanded.  XCOM2 is quite a bit more difficult than XCOM. If you've never played one I recommend going with the easy setting (or play the previous game instead to get a feel for the more simplified mechanics). I've beat several of the games in this series several times and it still took me 5 failed Ironman campaigns before succeeding on the 6th (some I abandoned early). FYI, if you want Ironman you have to restart after completing the tutorial mission.   I didn't do much with the DLC that appeared partway through my playthrough.

Frequent crashes and corrupt saves are too much of a frustration. I hope it will be patched but I wouldn't recommend this to any but a desperate fan in the current state. If you're interested in this game but haven't played the original, go play that first. It's a much better experience and basically the same game and hopefully by the time you're done they'll have fixed the stability issues.    Bugs I've hit - in case the feedback helps anyone (All of them findable on Google from other players):  - Game crash. During a black op mission about 10 turns in.   - Menu buttons disappearing/unclickable. The first 'urgent' mission prompt I failed because I was unable to click on the UI. Because it was the first play-through I didn't realize what happened until the end of month review told me I'd failed missions.   - Esc key and mouse weren't working on mission load. Loaded my last save on a fresh launch of the game and the esc key and menu are unresponsive. My squad can't be moved becasue the mouse clicks don't register. Number keys and tab work so friendly skills and overwatch were working fine. Had to alt-F4 to close the game and restart. Same save worked fine on second reload.   - Esc key and mouse are unresponsive at the ship (home base). Force quit and relaunch to reset.   9.2 hours played.

            "review_text": "This is a review of a full playthrough of the game on normal difficulty.  To clear things up real quick: I reloaded mid battle, time and time again. I do not know what it is like losing your troops over and over again due to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ percentages. This is however based on the design of the spotting system where suddenly the entire enemy squad that you just spotted starts moving all over the place, combine this with having spotted them with your last unit and you just turned from decent battle to half dead team with a single move. This is actually the worst part about the battle system in my opinion.   The game is famous for making you miss 95% chance hits, but looking at it realistically that did indeed only happen 5% of the time to me. I think people overestimate the misses because they actually DO lose units and not cheat like me.  What I always loved most about both this game and the first part is the arms race. You develop new technologies based on what you can grab from the aliens and then use that knowledge to get more powerful armor and weapons and it FEELS SO GOOD, when you just got the plasma sniper rifle and witness a beam like a deathstar shredding through the puny enemies, nothing can beat that feeling. Meanwhile the aliens put more and more powerful units on the field, both by buffing the HP and by introducing entirely new types of foes. (where the berserker at though? I saw like 2 throughout the entire game)   I also like your own unit variety, you can have experts in melee combat, slicing through the enemy with swords and shotguns, or the heavys, that carry enough explosive rounds to take out the enemy team by themselves as well as a minigun. Perhaps the deathstar sniper, sitting out of danger while being the danger is your style. Or the unusual psionik warrior, using mind control to force new friends?   Storywise it is...meh. Aliens have conquered the earth so now take it back by turning earth into vietnam. Predictable and not memorable.  The looks are pretty damn sweet in my opinion, particularly the effects of laser based weaponry and all that.  The music fits into the background and gets the job done, thats it.  Among the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ spotting system I also found myself strongly disliking the camera. Often it just didnt give the perfect view of the battlefield now matter how I turned it. Even worse though is the increase in frequency of crashes. The farther you got the more often you had to reload after a complete crash. This was already an issue in the first game.  The duration you should expect for a single playthrough, if you reload a lot like me, is about 40 hours. Is that worth 50 Euros/dollars/whatever ? Probably not. I reccomend waiting for a very big sale. All in all though if you liked the first part you will like this one as well. If you didnt play the first part you might wanna check that one out first, it should be cheaper and is just as good. Tl:dr: good game for its genre",

As it seems every enemy you run into does 5 different unique and op things. Mutons now have a melee attack similar to that of a Beserker? When a mission says moderate prepare to either have a walk in the park or a extremely bad time.  3- There is no excuse for the bugs in this game to not already be resolved. It has been a looong time since release. The game includes game breaking crashes, glitches when reloading saves, buggy animation(not even funny bugs), and horrible fps dips.   Other Glitches/Annoyances include  -Resistance Cap being wrong  -Save inconsistancies (Oh yesterday I contacted mexico and saved and the next I load up the save oh I have to do it again? Was not an error in saving because the game recognised a terror mission I had completed in mexico)  -Repetitive dialogue...(YES I KNOW SAVE THE CIVILIANS saying it more WON'T HELP ME)  -Random difficulty spikes (Almost all xcom games slightly have this problem, but for some reason this one more than others)  So in conclusion... If you like Xcom sure buy the game. I did and I'll muddle through all the bugs and pray for patches. But if you're new to Xcom in general... go buy Xcom Enemy Unknown and the Enemy Within Expansion it'll be a better experience for your first time.",

Now some pinpoints:   +very interesting story +great tactical challenges +good (but not great - no micromanagement) possibilities of the base management +random generated maps (the lack of this feature really brought down 2012 X-Com's replayability) +some timed missions but always enough time if you know what you are doing and how to play +fully generated maps also apply to the MP, so there is no more type of gamer 'I will learn by heart where to put my troops on 'bar' map.  - STABILITY ISSUE - sometimes game randomly crashes during combat (it happens even more often in multiplayer mode) - PERFORMANCE ISSUE - even with 8 GB of RAM and almost all possible software disabled or turned off (including of course all browsers) I'm experiencing some RAM related issues and long loading times -with time you will get a band of super, uber-human never dying squad of heroes with incredible skills (similarlly like 2012 X-Com) - it's far from reality and real combat situation (classical X-com had this feeling - soldiers would die in a combat with aliens all the time as they would normally do and no 'inhuman' skills were present; just some stats improvements with higher ranks) -no micromanagement AT ALL (again classical X-com had plenty of it - you had to make sure that you didn't forget to take ammo for your soldiers for the mission, you had to account for available space in Skyranger, you had to make sure that you have enough living space in a base for your personnel and storage for gear and items, and you had to even account even for travel time - if you recruit new soldiers they will not magically appear at your base in no time just like they were already walking impatiently around by the entrance just waiting to be enlisted... -if you lose your entire squad of super heroes for any reason you can expect to lose the game (campaign) in general. -unfortunately most of the tactical activity (with the exception for alien rulers) can be summed up in this simple scheme: move a soldier in your squad, trigger 'combat situation' with 3-4 aliens, deal with them (kill them all or at least most of them - it's your turn), repeat unit success... -in multiplayer you can build your squad only from predefined characters now - there is almost 0 customization now, not even armor type or weapons. You can choose only from few items (vests, granades etc) - it's a big step back comparing to the 2012 X-Com (oversimplification)  In general it's a great game and I had tons of fun with it. It may not seem that way after reading all those negative remarks but please be advised that I'm very demanding person. I would give it 82% if I was a professional reviewer. I would love to see next X-com with more connections to the classical game (more ambitious, better designed, more challenging, micromanagement) but of course with all bells and whistles of the current age and graphic cards possibilities.",

I was really hoping that with XCOM 2, they'd re-add some more of the tactical and strategic complexities of the originals.

There are some fights that you'll face especially if youre attempting a no-death campaign, that will make you tear your hair out, and the only solution is save-scumming (and this with the best of tactics, flanking, optimal-builds). Also some enemies will make you shake your head, facepalm, or some other reaction as to how irritating (not, necessarily dangerous, just plain irritating) they are, IM LOOKING AT YOU CODEX!  If you're a fan of the original xcom, this game fits the bill though, but be warned, the 'free-enemy turn' mechanic can annoy and frustrate at the higher levels (versus what we had in xcom when an enemy could easily be caught with their pants down), when you get 2+ groups activating at the same time, though this is generally through bad scouting or bad luck, not design.  On a personal note, I would recommend some mods for an initial playthrough, mostly slowing down the timers, as this can provide an excessive note of frustration/consternation for some that expected the more 'let me play at my pace' game setting. The timer still provides an incentive to hurry while the mod allows for a bit of leeway (and you don't feel the need to bullrush your squad into an area you KNOW is full of enemies just to get lose 1 or 2 of them simply to satisfy a stupid timer).",

            "review_text": "Getting into XCOM 2, I feared the worst; which was to be expected due to my numerous failed attempts through Enemy Unknown's campaign. Seriously, the whole 'countries-leaving-the-XCOM-project-lol-have-fun-juggling-this-♥♥♥♥♥how-worse-than-the-2016-elections' mechanic within the predecessor was my biggest gripe. Like, why would you pull out of the only program that is actively trying to HELP. So thankfully, when I heard that the sequel was kicking this arbitrary marker of country relations to the curb while also introducing a wealth of improvements and gameplay features, I was to say, pretty hyped.  So after picking this up for about $30 on a sale (and honestly, I'm going to say it now, I don't really think this is worth the full $60), logging about 35 hours into it during my first play through, and being completely blown away by how I could actually finish the final mission (which I'll touch on later), I'm ready to talk about my opinions which no one gives a ♥♥♥♥ about and is better off reading a review from another individual whose proficiency at voicing their opinions far exceed my own.  Anyway.  First,  Story   So canonically, Firaxis said, '♥♥♥♥ you and your skill' and based XCOM 2's narrative story off of a timeline where the XCOM Project in Enemy Unknown failed and bent over for the aliens to take over. ~20 years or so later, the aliens have basically converted Earth's civilization into a glorified North Korea, calling their governing force ADVENT. So now, you're at the head of a resistance movement, going on the Global Offensive against the aliens to take back what was once yours: sabotaging their facilities, partaking in guerilla operations, repelling their retaliation strikes upon your outposts, and repeatedly rushing B bomb site with SMG's. Anyway, let's move on because, let's be honest, who plays XCOM for the story?    Gameplay  The gameplay, for the most part, remains the same as Enemy Unknown. It's the same old formula of dropping your soldiers which you spent hours customizing into alien territory then getting heartbroken due to the death of one soldier and save-scumming to bring them back to life, missing 95% chance to hit shots on aliens, getting shot with a 10% hit chance from aliens, and getting too cocky and alerting another pod of aliens without finishing off the first wave.  However, one new mechanic has been added which introduces a myriad of strategic and tactical plays: concealment. Now, if you're like me and have absolutely no sense of opportunity, concealment won't be such a big deal. But an intellectual, opportunistic individual like the person reading this wonderful review will have MUCH more options on how to start a mission. The gimmick here is that on most missions, your soldiers start off concealed from the aliens, allowing for strategic ambushes and sneaking around the map. This mechanic really fixes the problem I had with the first game where I would trigger a pod of aliens at the end of my turn, thus giving the aliens a free chance to move in and wipe my squad.  As I said above, I thanked God and the heavens above that the 'countries-pulling-out-of-the-XCOM-Project' system was replaced with a more traditional doomsday meter. Said traditional doomsday meter coming in the form of The Avatar Project. Without talking about potential spoilers, I'll just say that this new Game Over time bomb still retains the same sense of urgency while introducing new and fun ways of counteracting it.  There's also the new classes, but barring the Specialist and the Ranger's sweet-♥♥♥ blade, it's just the old Enemy Unknown classes with new perks and a name-change.   Graphics/Sound/Performance  Meh, the graphics are what you would expect Enemy Unknown to look like in 2016. Lots of customizable graphical effects and whatnot. Clearly, I'm not an expert when it comes to GFX.  The sound design in this game is top-notch. Dramatic musical scores when the game calls for it and eerie, somber silence after the death of a soldier. It is definitely a step up from Enemy Unknown, which from what I remember, had the sound design of a porno with music blasting at the most 'inappropriate' times.  At launch, I heard of issues pertaining to performance and clipping. It being August now, most of the bugs and issues seem to be fixed for the most part. My play through was fine in regards to performance and graphics. Keep in mind that I play on a GTX 750 Ti without an SSD, but even then, the immersion was never really broken and everything was smooth sailing.   THE FINAL LEVEL  I'm not going to write a full-on rant on why the final mission was a mess. But without going into spoiler territory, I personally think this mission was a wild ramp-up in terms of difficulty. The enemy count on this final mission shot straight up like Nintendo's stock after PoGo compared to the other missions before it. It's like giving 5th graders the SAT instead of their usual state-wide assessments. Sure, several sectopods, mutons, archons, and sectoids are fine; but overloading the final stretch of the mission with a ♥♥♥♥♥torm of enemies is just bad level design. Again, this is just my opinion.   Conclusion?  XCOM 2 is alright.    ...Heh, actually, XCOM 2 is a huge step up from Enemy Unknown in terms of just plain game design. You can tell Firaxis listened to the community after the first game and incorporated our ideas into the game while simultaneously keeping the core gameplay aspects of XCOM alive and well. I 100% missed some things, but hey, I'm just some weeaboo entitled to his own opinion. Anyways, DEFINITELY pick up this game on a sale if you're a fan of alien genocide.     ",

Even then, gameplay flows like a river of magnets and a super-glue covered sloth could pour 5 gallons of molasses by the time a mission gets around to loading.   The menu navigation is slow and laggy, and it takes around nine years for the aliens to look up from their hideous torture of God's beatiful creatures and realize it's their turn to move. Doing ANYTHING (building, researching, training, healing, and most importantly, SCANNING) is impossible without being interrupted by a flood of urgent missions. SERIOUSLY! I had up to five missions come in in less than three in-game days! Most scans take at least 4 days (I think), and scans are required to get ANY currency, even supplies given to you by the council.    Much like the first game, playing a mission through without save-scumming is like trying to get a seven-ten split after undergoing a quadruple amputation and a botched lobotomy. That being said, there are mods that speed up menu navigation and other side-effects of poor optimization, and despite everything wrong with this game, I've still played WAYY too much of it, so it's doing something right. So basically, if you liked Xcom UE or just have an extra bit of money laying around, definitely get this game.",

Now something more serious: Performance updates will surely come, either official from Firaxis or unofficial from the modding community, just give them some time, because the game needs them.  Gameplay wise, there are a lot of mechanics that EU/EW didn't have (some were introduced in Long War mod), and many things now work like they were supposed to, like removing overwatch with damage, it was strange in EU/EW to throw a grenade to the face of an enemy and nope, he is still overwatching.  The randomly generated maps good and gives good replayability potential, which is VERY important in a single player game.  People complain the turn limit is the worst thing... I'm not sure about you but going blue move into overwatch (which I believe has been buffed btw, its now 0.9 instead of 0.7 penalty) for all my soldiers isn't exactly what I call 'fun', that's one of the reasons turn limit was implemented. You have concealment most of the times and you can rush for the first two turns. This isn't about exploiting the most OP strategy, it's just doing what you think it's the best to do each turn while staying alive.  TL;DR: Good game, buy if you have good PC. If not, stay alert and wait until performance patches come unless you want to play on 30- fps or min settings (it is playable, it's not that bad).

The only error I've had so far was a graphical glitch on a retaliation mission where there was no fog of war, and the screens colour pallete was entirely red, and switched every 2ms to a colour pallete of green, and when it zoomed out, everything was fine but flashing black. I pushed through the mission and haven't had the error since. I've seen a lot of people complaining about the difficulty, and I gotta throw my 2 cents in. It's one of those sequels that assumes you played the first. The entire game is harder than XCOM:EU/EW, but in a good way. It expects you to know basic technics and such, and expects you to have a more tactical mindset instead of just firing every turn and hoping for shots to connect. Play XCOM:EU/EW first, and do so right before playing this game. Naturally any skills and techniques you had in your mind while playing XCOM:EU/EW 4 years ago aren't going to be fresh, so plow through those, on at least classic difficulty, then start playing this game. And a single mistake could wipe your entire squad. Plan your moves. Get your soldiers to cooperate. Think before moving ahead. It took me over 35 hours to finish the campaign on normal, and I didn't even buy every weapon upgrade.",

Snipers are still good, but no longer totally ridiculous. And the turn timers force you to develop new tactics besides just creaping and overwatching all the time. It's stressfull to get used to, but now that I have I like it better.   2. It's too similar to EU, in my opinion. Like it's basically the same game, but improved a bit. I would like to have seen all new enemies, weapons, etc. As it stands, there are only a handfull of new things that aren't just updates of old stuff. Also, as with EU, theres too much Tier1, Teir2, Teir3 equipment that's just the same stuff but better. Even the story was very similar.  3. 1 and 2 make it sound bad, but it's really not. The gameplay is still meaty, technical, and addictive. Overall I would recommend it, but I think they played it too safe and didn't change enough.  Update: I tried multiplayer a bit, and it's mess. There were only like 2 people on when I tried, and one guy would leave the lobby as soon as he saw it was me (since I beat him once). That's excusable, but on top of that I finally found another apponent, and got halfway into a cool battle, and the game crashed.. with no way to resume the match. This happend not once, but twice in one session.  The game never once crashed, or glitched durring the single player, but the multiplayer is the oposite, it REAKS of being tacked on as an afterthought. Honestly, if there was no multiplayer I wouldn't really be bothered. But playing half of a few games really got me excited about it, which made it a huge bummer when I realized it's basically unplayable.",

Secondly, managing your ship, the Avenger, is even more of a hassle; without enough engineers, you're going to be progressing at a slow pace. Plus the cost of buying new equipment is much higher than it was in EU and EW. So choose your projects wisely! Lastly, I'm having technical difficulties with the framerate and graphics. This game should run fairly smoothly with my PC: it's decked out with an NVIDIA GeForce GT 755M graphics card, a 3.2 Ghz Intel Core i5, and 16 GB of memory space. Instead it can barely get through the loading screen without grinding to a halt.   Other than that, this is what I've been waiting for! Firaxis took everything from EU and EW, cleaned it up, added new features, and delievered on their promises (sort of). The wider customization options for our soldiers is definetly worth checking out. Furthermore the sound, music, characters, and story line is all just superb.   Of course it's been out for a few day, but with enough patching and a strong modding community this game will shine. Just give it some time to grow.",

If you liked XCOM: Enemy Unknown, then you will like this game, because in my mind it is simply a better version of that game with many cool and new features.  My issues with the game: 1) There is a weird problem a lot of people seem to be having were on the first retaliation mission with Chryssalids reloading the game will cause crashes, the easy fix and what I did is to play this mission through without reloading, after this I never had the problem again, still pretty annoying for save scum like me.  2) I am struggling to find a lot of replay value in this game, playing through once was amazing, but there aren't any second wave options so far as I can see, the only thing you can do is ironman. This means that I basically bought a $60 campaign, a pretty great one but still they could have left this feature in and made replay far more compelling. Edit: I still wish they would add second wave options, but the mods and dlc both gave pretty good replay value later in time.  3) The bleed out mechanic is borderline idiotic to me. In about 15-20 deaths, I have never had one of my soldiers bleed out instead of dying out right, even though I have had a few majors and one colonel die. After looking it up the best explanation I have found is that the bleed out chance is will-100 as a % unless you upgrade it at which point it becomes will-50 as a %. So chance is actually fairly low which seems silly.  4) I got the day 1 edition which came with some sort of personalization pack, I don't remember the name. What I do know is that it was really stupid. If you are looking to buy the game I wouldn't spend more money for the day 1 edition.  All of that said I love this game and don't regret the purchase at all. The above problems were easy for me to overlook. If you like the XCOM series I recommend buying this game.

The design behind the story plays out really well with the advancement of technology. You can often find yourself without efficient amount of resources to combat the advent. So making decisions to invest on certain equipment and targeting specific dark event missions can your make game easier or harder. Even with absolute perfect decision makings, the enemy does progress in equipment and enemy types as well, so even when you feel overpowered it may not remain that way for long, until you reach endgame godhood.  On average difficulties you can break the game balance fairly well on end game and take your sweet time to research all the remaining technology and build all possible equipment, long as you keep suppressing their avatar facilities. Not to worry thou, early and mid-game the avatar project will put pressure on you to start advancing towards their blacksites ASAP, despite if your ready or not.  In overall its good package and excellent turn-based strategy. No doubt the modding community will make it even more awesome later on.   - Warning - The game does have glitches which most of them aren't game breaking, but can hurt the immersion and cause some minor annoyances. Nothing that cant be polished away overtime thou. ",

XCOM 2 is very much a upgrade from the previous, XCOM Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within. When coming into the game, you will notice the overall XCOM bugs such as some (very few) walls and doors being invisible to the enemies, however, it also has too many things better than XCOM1 than I can mention. A few being much better visual and sound FX, a better design of excavating, to a whole new system of creating and manifacturing items.

My first time going through a timed mission, I made the rookie mistake of rushing my team to the objective. The results cost me dearly. This game punishes stupidity and the impatiant, but rewards brillance and the cunning. Secondly, managing your ship, the Avenger, is even more of a hassle; without enough engineers, you're going to be progressing at a slow pace. Plus the cost of buying new equipment is much higher than it was in EU and EW. So choose your projects wisely! Lastly, I'm having technical difficulties with the framerate and graphics. This game should run fairly smoothly with my PC: it's decked out with an NVIDIA GeForce GT 755M graphics card, a 3.2 Ghz Intel Core i5, and 16 GB of memory space. Instead it can barely get through the loading screen without grinding to a halt.   Other than that, this is what I've been waiting for! Firaxis took everything from EU and EW, cleaned it up, added new features, and delievered on their promises (sort of). The wider customization options for our soldiers is definetly worth checking out. Furthermore the sound, music, characters, and story line is all just superb.   Of course it's been out for a few day, but with enough patching and a strong modding community this game will shine. Just give it some time to grow.",

I appreciate that this means the gameplay has changed in Xcom 2 in that there are no real firefights. Cover either gets blown away so that you can kill pods in 1 turn. Or you stun the enemy so it can't fight back. It feels very much like Xcom 1 end game after only a few missions in Xcom 2.   One negative for me was the reduction in base management. And whilst the 'base defense' mission was fun and I can see why it was like that to save art asset resources, I'd have actually preferred a base to defend.

Firaxis clearly has no idea what they're doing when it comes to optimization and overall engine fidelity.  This is just another horrendous display of a company not giving the slightest ♥♥♥♥ about its consumers once again.  I don't care if this game is good. I know it's good. It's a major improvement in XCOM EU/EW in most ways so far. Most of which are UI and overarching map system.  But the sheer amount of bugs, performance issues, and glitches are nothing short of pathetic.  I am not even going to address the issue people are having with turn timers on nearly every mission. I don't know if it's a poor design choice yet, but any game I've ever played that restricted me with a timer that wasn't an arcade game I have profusely hated.  Here are my specs: GTX 780 OCd +130 core/memory i5 3570k OCd slightly 8gb RAM 850 EVO 500gb SSD Playing on 1080p  This computer can play pretty much any game that is properly optimized on max or close to max settings at 1080p.  Let me compile a  short list  of the  few  problems I've encountered so far for you. I will continue to update it as I find more.  - Game doesn't run at 60 fps consistently on any system on Earth. You must disable AA and I have to completely disable shadows to even sit anywhere near 60 when playing. I can play Arkham Knight, one of the most notoriously bad PC ports of this generation, at an average of 50-60 fps on high settings. No, not when driving the Batmobile, and yes I'm talking about after it was patched months later - No option for resolutions over 1080p in settings. It's obviously editable in the .ini but why the hell does a PC exclusive game not have this built into the options menu ingame? - Loading times are  HORRENDOUSLY  long, both when loading a game and starting a mission. XCOM EU took about 3 seconds to get into a mission. This game seems to take 60 seconds or more - I timed loading my saved game from the menu. 73 seconds is what it takes every single time I want to load my game up - Overwatch is delayed 10 seconds or more sometimes when enemies trigger it - Enemies are delayed several seconds once they are aware of you - End of turn also delayed several seconds (starting to see a theme here?) - Sometimes your units decide to shoot in the complete opposite direction at a 70 degree angle facing the Moon and pull off a move like Anjolina Jolie in Wanted. This is only a graphical bug but it also existed in XCOM EU/EW so good job on fixing that, ♥♥♥♥♥♥s - Majority of your time is spent shooting through or getting shot through walls which apparently do not really exist and serve no purpose in the XCOM 2 universe - Snake ♥♥♥♥s grab you through the non-existent walls constantly - Melee enemies can hit you from 2 tiles away if there is a gap between you and the enemy - You cannot shoot at enemies who have not 'detected' you yet. By this I mean if you have already come out of hiding and there are wandering units around the map, even if you can clearly see them and have even used a battle scanner, you cannot shoot until you physically trigger them by walking close or throwing a grenade - ENEMIES GET A FREE TURN TO KILL YOUR UNITS AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN SPOTTED. THIS IS ESPECIALLY NICE WHEN YOU'VE USED ALL OF YOUR UNITS TURNS AND A GROUP OF ENEMY UNITS DECIDE TO SHOW UP WITHOUT AN INVITATION - Game has crashed once while in the options menu - Getting stuck on character edit screen during the tutorial and not being able to go back requiring force quit - Screen goes black after starting a mission every single time which causes confusion as the game seems frozen. If you open steam ingame chat it will no longer load properly\\ - When your unit shoots and is next to glass they play an animation to break the glass but nothing happens to it half the time - Game feels to render floors of buildings if you move a unit that is on the ground and your last available unit is on a second or third floor - If Central/Shen/Tygan are talking and you go to the geoscope or open ingame chat, they stop talking and you can't hear their dialogue anymore  Also it takes an ungodly amount of time just to complete 1 turn in this game. For 2 enemies to actually do their ♥♥♥♥, it can take upwards of a minute for them to do what they have to do before it's your turn. That's with 2 enemies. Now imagine 5 or more.  The worst part is these are only the issues I've personally encountered. There are dozens more problems littering the community forums that I haven't even seen yet personally.  Why was this game delayed for 3 months? What the hell were they doing? Was Jake Solomon just jacking it behind his desk every day for those 3 months? And don't you find it funny how much of a striking resemblance Central bears to Jake Solomon now? It's almost like he had the dev team model him after himself. What a coincidence!  A game should never be this broken on day 1. The only excuse any genre of gaming has is MMOs which massively underestimate server capacities and have issues for days or even weeks. Take a look at any recently released games that had either minimal or no major issues.  Rise of the Tomb Raider The Witness Rainbow Six Siege Rocket League Helldivers Grand Theft Auto 5 Metal Gear Solid 5 Just Cause 3 (AMD GPUs excluded) Hell, even the Division Beta ran better than this ♥♥♥♥  Again, I was expecting this game to be a buggy mess, but not to this extent. Developers should not be given ridiculously high metacritic scores by reviewers (a 91 at this time) when this many issues exist. They're either completely oblivious to how these issues affect gameplay, or they're actually payed off.  There are also several other reasons why I have issues with this game. Cover seems to be about as useless as not being in cover. ♥♥♥♥ tier Advent enemies hit me across the map while I'm in full cover with ease. The melee variants have insane movement range and get a free hit any time they aren't killed right away. Oh, and they have double the health of normal grunts. If they're triggered at the end of your turn, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. They can also stun or make your units unconcious.  Either way, this game will not be comfortably playable for weeks, or even months. Or maybe not ever. Who knows when it comes to Firaxis.   ♥♥♥♥ off.",

One bug I experienced was my soldier stuck inside a truck, and only reloading a save fixed it. This of course led to me dying and losing the first fight. Another common bug I am experiencing (in every mission) is when I issue my solider an attack command and they will do nothing (I have sat there for 5+ minutes to see if anything would happen). The game appears to be working externally but internally something has went seriously wrong. The only way to fix it is to load a save. You will experience random crashes, usually associated with loading saves.   They seem capable of releasing paid DLC but yet no message on fixing any bugs. It is a smack in the face and an insult.   Do not support the developers until they fix this crap. They should not be allowed to get away with this, especially when they are releasing paid DLC.

You recommend a GTX 770 with 2GB of VRAM and my 1080 has quadruple that yet still sturggles to output anything higher than 50fps in intensive scenes. God forbid I max this game out, I'm lucky to obtain 40 in most areas of the game.   I wish I could give this game a positive review, because if it were to run consistently well I would be playing a hell of a lot more of it, however the performance problems on what (upon launch) has been a PC exclusive is simply unacceptable, and quite frankly I regret handing money over for a half finished game.

A lot of this game seems familiar but the few differences are enough to make me stop playing. I wasn't having fun. At no point was I really. I was just grinding the many encounters hoping to get over the hill and start dominating. That pace is what i loved about the other games. I also couldn't enjoy the economy, building, crafting aspect because I was constantly being thrown into fights. I'm guessing a lot people liked this but I didn't at all. The pace of each mission was either crawl forward and overwatch or sprint forward because the mission had a turn counter. Seemed like a cheap way to keep the player from not getting cozy. It was just annoying not excting. Maybe because almost every mission is like this. It gets old considering the amount of encounters you face. I also got this game long after it's release so you'd think the performance issues would be fixed but this makes my brand new enthusiast build seem like a 10 year old build. You don't get anything out of that either. The graphics are meh and it makes no sense why the game is struggling at all. It's turn-based with not much moving at once.  Pros:  Lots of encounters Lots of enemies to fight Enemies have new abilites New Xcom soldier classes with new abilities Spark units (from DLC) Ruler bosses (from DLC)  Cons:  Too many encounters Too many enemies Lacks out-of-combat game content or at least you don't get time to experience it Poor graphics Poor performance  I'd only recommend this game to someone who likes to mindlessly fight waves of enemies and not much else.",

            "review_text": "Game is broken and unbalanced, and central mechanics are treated as a formality. Yes, the enemy will have a penalty to hitting you when you stand next to a stack of bricks, but it doesn't affect the line of sight in any way. Zombies will melee you through walls, and vipers will snatch you with their tongue from the other side of a parking lot and drag you through every single car on the way, or from the top of a building, hidden behind a railing. As soon as you lose concealment, every active enemy on the map knows exactly where every single unit you have is located. I say 'active' because the only thing keeping the entire map from coming after you is the fact that some groups of enemies are braindead until YOU see THEM.  It's ridiculous how a well positioned and entrenched squad gets decimated because a viper and a lancer works together and uses unfair range to snatch, crush and incapacitate a unit in one round. Sectoids apparently don't even need a direct line of sight to use their abilities. I've seen them posess people and raise zombies (I don't know if they have an upper limit for how many they can raise) from the other side of a building, halfway across the map and out of reach for my squad.   'Well just git gud' you'd probably tell me, or tell me to take my time and use positioning and conservative tactics to carefully cross the map, but in most cases where some unpredictable element doesn't rush out of nowhere and ruins your day in one round, the mission timer will force you to be reckless. You got caught in a prolonged battle in the middle of a street, but you have to push past the enemy and risk getting shot in the back just so time won't run out and your whole squad goes MIA.  I don't recommend the game, and I see no point in buying DLCs for a rushed and broken game.",

            "review_text": "So as there have been a lot said about this I feel like I want to make some things clear in my short review as to what I think about it:  - Timers Quite a number of people seem to find them terrible, they want to be able to take it slow and make the perfect ambush or whatever. Sure, install some mods, or edit the ini file or the console, there is many ways to make this your experience as you want it. However, looking at this from the game and the story of the game, not having timers on several of missions, wouldn't make sense. It is a game about being an endangered rebel group, hunted by a far superior force, on a planet that has given up and is under almost complete alien control. So when you make a move in a 'danger' zone, it doesn't take long for the aliens to notice and as such you have to make use of a short window of opportunity. Other times, you just have to get to the objective in time and then you have an infinite number of rounds to finish of the alien forces, as it is not an important area.   The gist is: You are in war, it is not fought on your terms, but the aliens. You fight to keep up and adjust. You face ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situations and things might not go the way you want, but you deal with it - and keep fighting. If you want to be a powerful killing force, join the aliens (let’s assume someone makes that kind of mod) or make you adjustments. Me I enjoy that the gameplay matches the world and the story.   - Performance: On my computer (with everything max) I only ever see framerate drops just before and after loading when moving from mission area to HQ (cut scene). The rest runs smooth enough for me. I do however have a fairly powerful rig. And keep in mind that no drivers for it has been released yet, which will likely make a difference.  - Bugs/Glitches: I've seen a few. Mostly just parts going through a wall, some odd environmental destruction, one camera view that got weird, when hacking (trying the action again fixed it) and finally the biggest one I experienced was that the AI suddenly stopped working. They just stood there, not doing anything. Restarting the game fixed that issue.  So with that out of the way, I will say about this I that without even being close to finishing this, it already feels better than the last X-COM, while still keeping intact the splendor that made me an instant fan of the series. They just added so much more. Now I can actually create the squad I wanted (Suicide Squad in this case) and actually make it somewhat look like them. I find myself writing biographies and spending a whole lot of time on the customizing, and yes that just makes having several of them killed even worse. So what do you do? You strive even harder to be perfect, to master the tactics and put the odds in your favor.  It’s a very special game that needs to be played to be truly understood. Just looking at it doesn't really sell the game. It took me a while to get started on the last game (Enemy Unknown the expansion managed to arrive before I did) even though multiple of my friends was playing it and highly recommending it. I saw them play and I just couldn't see the appeal. Then after a sale and with a summer vacation looming I decided to give it a try.. the next 5 days went in a blur, and I've been in love ever since.   Is it worth full price? Yes! Was it worth a pre-order? Yes! (And I usually never pre-order) Worth it on sale? Of course! Still some bugs? Yes. Perfect? No, but damn good anyway. For me, this is the best game of 2016, and I am rather certain that I will stick to that idea even though the year has just begun.",

            "review_text": "XCOM 2: The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly  Okay. I've put some time in this game, about 18 hours. This game is better than Firax's first XCOM game (notice how specific I am). It does some things great and does some things stupidly. The game is good enough that I put in a lot of time already with it and it kept me going. But there were many occasions along that journey that really, really starts aggravating me.  THE GOOD  I don't mind the setting. I don't mind how the reborn XCOM takes up after the first organization's failure. I don't mind the whole insurgent angle of the game. It's markedly different from other games with the XCOM/X-Com name. The story so far has been decent. The game goes out of its way to have you call each soldier your own. The character customization, weapon modifications is great. Being able to tweak many aspects brings a bit more individuality.   The languages offered is nice for variety as I prefer a nationality to speak their native tongue. It would be nice to have more of the major nationalities with their language to choose from and I hope this gets expanded upon in the future. I get attached to certain soldiers, especially my performers and being able to customize them to this game's extent is nice.  So far with the early game, it's nice having to juggle how supplies and resources are spent. I can't have everything and I have to decide what gets researched and built up first. I'm not at endgame so I can't tell how this aspect holds up witih late game where players tend to have everything.  I appreciate the multi level/floor/tier of the maps, something some of the other games that have pursued the X-Com style of play have failed in, one in particular that only had flat and level maps :\\ XCOM2 is still a far cry from the possible sprawl of maps done in the very old X-Com Apocalypse. You could go into an urban sprawl with buildings having 10 floors. I just wish the franchise would be able to go to maps of that variety and depth, but oh well.  THE BAD  Inconsistencies in combat with LOS for both you and the Advent. Characters on both sides routinely see and shoot through walls and buildings. It's hard to get any sense of the terrain for tactical usefulness and dangers when everyone seems to just ignore walls and buildings like they don't exist. Seeing the action cam views of people taking shoots at a target but there's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ entire building blocking the view, yet everyone shoots like those things don't exist.  More examples of this same LOS inconsistency? Vipers will use their tongue grab on your soldier that is completley isolated in the interior of a building with no door and windows that the Viper should reach him with. Hand thrown Grenades respect the LOS game but Grenade Launchers? No. You can shoot from the deep interior of a building with a roof and no openings to the target/target area.  In XCOM2's combat, there a word that you will get very familiar with for your soldiers: 'MISSED!'  THE UGLY  Time is not only against you in XCOM2, it hates you.  In the strategic view, you are spammed missions constantly, a lot of which are high priority missions. It just piles up. It feels like I cannot go 1-2 days to complete a 3-6 day scan before the next war critical mission comes up that I HAVE to do.  It's like someone gave Fallout 4's Preston Garvey the mission design lead and he dived into it with a burning hatred for prospective players.  When you go into the tactical missions themselves, many of these press you for time with limited turns to accomplish goals. Time is such an issue that it adversely affects tactical options in this game. The constraints are so tight that this game is down to a zerg rush. A-To-B tactics and nothing fancy. No flanking. No roundabout routes. Frontal assault is all that matters.  The game forces such a premium on making you rush that I've opting out of using my sharpshooters/snipers now. The nature of their form of fighting, where they cannot fire their sniper rifle unless they stay in place means they severely lag behind the rest of the team. In a game where time is constantly forcing the player to PUSH FORWARD PUSH FORWARD PUSH FORWARD, Sharpshooters are the most useless class I have. Even the Grenadiers with their miniguns and grenade launchers offer a more mobile, aggressive style of fighting that suits this game.  Another wonderful feature of the game is with these same time constraints in combat, towards the end, you're rushing headlong for the extraction zone. LOL! That's when the game drops Advent reinforcements in the extraction zone when you have 1-2 turns left before you fail or whoever hasn't extracted, gets left behind for capture.  ========== Overall the game is a mixed bag. There are things that I absolutely HATE in this game. But there are things that are just wonderful. The campaign, basic idea of the story, outifitting and customizing your soldiers are great. The things that are bad however really started getting to me.",

            "review_text": "So, I really wanted to like the game. I've played it through, five times now, and while the second time through had some nicer features, it still feels broken. Being a big fan of the original, and seeing as how this is basically the only game in the genre, when it finally came on sale for like, 30 dollars, I was super happy to finally get to play the game.   And boy, it was a big let down. In a lot of ways. My honest opinion is that it's not worth 60 bucks. Buy it on sale, hopefully 30 bucks or less. It feels less like a new game, and more like a horrible mod. It's only saving grace is the community modder base who can make it 10 times better (reccomend Long war perk pack among all of them), so here I go. While I ultimately have a positive view of the game, it is fundamentally flawed. I've had fun with it but I don't know whether or not I hate it or love it. I had an even bigger review written up but due to the 1000 charachter limit, this won't work. So, here's a list of problems with it.   -Line of Sight is fundamentally screwed up. You find yourself eitheir glitching through walls or simply 'triggering' aliens by taking 1 step to the left, in places it doesn't even make sense. Or not being able to shoot aliens right in front of you etc. As a LOS based tactics game, screwing up this part of the game just makes it feel broken and honestly, it almost makes it unplayable in some areas.  -Everything is random, the game is balanced on you getting things like new ammunition or armor mods, or the right weapon upgrades and so on, but these things are completely random. It's fun when you actually get to play certain aspects of the game but this is so incredibly rare as to be almost irrelevant. I didn't even know that UFO missions existed until my second play through, that's how rare and random some of the features are. You will sometimes not get any of them.   -The timers are horrific. Not only do you have a razor thin amount of time to complete missions, but even the logistics system 'month' is only 21 days, and you have to spend 3 days to collect your money. Yeah. You don't instantly get new money, you have to wait hovering over stuff for it. So, good luck spending 18 days doing ♥♥♥♥ and getting constantly interrupted. Honestly, this is the most broken element of the entire game, as it forces you to abandon your tactics and strategies and instead get from point A to point B without any real strategic goal. As a defensive game (you want aliens to discover you, rather than you discover them, in order to win) this pretty much breaks the game. I reccomend 'true concealmet' and 'configurable timers' as mods to make this more enioyable.  -The maps are tiny and you tend to accidentally bump in to 6-9 aliens at atime. Not even kidding you, nearly every time you move when you're near an alien another pod of aliens will be within 2 tiles of them. So, moving 2 tiles means now you have to fight 9 guys. Given that you are legitimately weaker in this version of the game (until you get super powers later on which just feels cheap, like doing double damage every turn), you're far more likely to die than in the original. And random mobs will pop up and attack you out of your control, acting like landmines. It's just overall too random and the clustered maps feels broken considering that xcom is about not discovering aliens too quickly.  -The game's style and story are lackluster. Notably, they removed Etherals and added in the Archon and Andromedon, two new aliens that make 0 sense to be in the game. The style clashes with itself and honestly it feels like they tried too hard to make the game feel like portal or overwatch. It ends up being bleh. I reccomend playing it without sound.   -The loading times are atrocious. For a game where you go back and load old saves due to perma deaths, it can take up to 5 minutes to for the load screen to open, then another 5 minutes to actually click on the load thing, then another 5 minutes to get it. Oh, and if you accidentally glitch again by having a guy see through a wall or something stupid like that, it's back to load it again! Honestly, it's the most frustrating thing of the game. Even with a great computer and mine is great, it's super slow. Even loading a mission or returning home adds needless minutes to your game. I'd honestly say that 10-20% of the game is just waiting for the loading timers. When it's fun, it's fun, when it's bad, it's REALLY bad. If you like watching paint dry or grass grow, this is the game for you. Good luck trying to play if your game glitches a lot.  -Concealment only lasts for the start of the mission. New items are completely random and you never get to choose the one's you want (which yes, is as stupid as it sounds). Pretty much all the new features add almost nothing to the game at all. This was a huge bummer to me as I thought they really stood a chance to change the gameplay logistics and instead it was a throway gimmick that you get once at the beggining of a mission. Really dumb concealment mechanic. Why take the trouble of designing it in to the game and then only have it once? I don't get it.   -The aliens are really overpowered and you are really underpowered, and later on in the game this switches. They give you special magical abilities like doing double damage later on but, it just feels broken. I don't mean that it's hard, I mean that the aliens take forever to kill and can kill you in one hit. If you don't attack the enemy without getting attacked once every play through, you pretty much can expect 14 day waiting periods where you're totally inept or for someone to die. Rather than fix this by rebalancing the game, you just get more powerful items and powers that allow you to do so much extra damage it becomes too easy. So later on, now you are too powerful. The game feels like it has almost no balance. It's more of a rock-papers-scissors thing, as you need certain classes to destroy the armor of certain units, certain classes to stun other units and so on, rather than playing the one's you want. Oh and, it's all completely random so, good luck playing through if you don't get two grenaiders. You might as well re-roll if you don't have at least one grenaider, it will be impossible to play without shredder.   The real simple issue of the game could be described as two sets of game mechanics that work in opposite directions. One of them wants you to play defensivley, and one of them forces you to complete things in a certain amount of time or instantly lose the game. The mish-mash of awkward styles, mechanics and the sheer randomness make it not very fun. I enjoy a challenge, I've played X-Com and xenonauts and all the originals, but, this game sucks. It's not that it's too hard, it's that it's broken. It's barely playable and, if it wasn't for the mods, I would have quit it a long time ago. Seriously, invest in to the mods.",

I'd like to start of with the negatives of the game as there aren't very many if i'm honest (spoilers on the above question i guess XD) Well, first off i think the most glaring problem is the performance which is pretty bad for a game like this. The game is running well on my PC but most people report issues and the game even lags and slows down for me sometimes. Firaxis hasn't exactly bent over backwards to release updates however which is pretty frustrating to say the least. The Introduction of timers is mixed for me but sometimes really frustrates me, making me wish they were not in the game but there are mods for this so that issue can easily be sorted. Finally, i feel the geoscape area of the campaign (overall strategy section, not battle tactics) can sometimes be a little linear as some 'multiple' choice operations can easily be narrowed down due to an obvious benefit to picking a certain OP over another.  With the bad stuff outa' the way, lets look at the stuff it gets right and there's a lot so i'm gonna bullet point it: . Crazy soldier customisation . Better strategic campaign design . Huge variety of Alien enemies . Game is a challenge- a good one . Story is actually very interesting, i was thinking about the ending long after i finished the game itself . Graphics are superb for this type of game . Music soundtrack is awesome . Good variety of missions . MODS!!!!!!!!!! . Good rate of new enemies throughout the game . Map design is excellent, even though most are randomly generated so you are going to see a huge variety of maps!  AND MOST OF ALL, the game is just insanely fun, as you sit there pondering your options and you think you're making brilliant strokes of pure strategy, while soon after you realise your best guy is gonna die because you were stupid and as a result you weep and feel like you could give up on life. After all, THAT'S XCOM BABY :D  So yes, yes this game is worth the £35-40 price tag so do yourself a favour and join the fight to free earth! FOR XCOM, VIGILO CONFIDO! 9/10 :)",

            "review_text": "Picked up this game solely on my experience with Enemy Unknown; so...  Is it good, bad, game of the year?  Let me break it down for you:  First thing is that this is turn-based strategy and everything is probabilities so you basically live or die by the math.random function; if either of those are as hostile to your being as 1 bar atomosphere to an Andromdon then you might want to give this a miss.  That said the game has an interesting premise and adds some really great mechanics to what we got in the first game (Acual stealth for one) and the amount of customisation is ridiculous (in a good way). On the whole the gameplay is solid and there's some interesting variety in missions, maps and situations. The plot on a whole is also more engaging and the motives make much more sense (particularly the aliens) then the first game which... I mean... What even?  But it ain't perfect by a long shot.  The game's story sometimes makes the same kind of massive logic leaps that became a hallmark of Enemy Within/ Enemy Unknown fortunately it doesn't detract from the overall plot but will it leave you in in disorientated state for three turns on occasion. Performance is also an issue, the game is still at time of writing rather poorly optimised; part of this is the fact that the game's default priority level is below normal and while that can be fixed, the really annoying stuttering and audio desync during cutscenes can't. There are also a couple of obvious bugs that clearly weren't fixed during the test phase: animation fails (as in enemies sliding across the map, etc), random slow-motion, poor or incomplete nav-meshes, units (particularly GREMILINS) falling thru the map and the enemy AI sometimes going out for a drink and forgeting all about you are all in here. Basically the game feels likes its missing a about a month of polish which will hopefully come in the patches.  In summary, if you enjoyed the first XCOM you'll have fun with this game, if you like turn-based strategy you'll like this game, If you like playing high-stakes poker with the Collectors from Mass Effect you'll love this game. Otherwise, you might want to save your money for the Division.",

Yes every review of XCOM 2, the game is unoptimized, but does that mean you can't enjoy it. I played half of XCOM 2 on 15 fps, and not a moment went by where I wasn't disappointed in the game.   My personal experience with XCOM was, despite the low fps, smooth. No other bugs were encountered, and no other significant problem presented itself. It was just pure fun for me. Later on I changed the graphics to be set lower and I got 20-30 fps, but it the 15-20 wasn't really a big deal for me.   The gameplay is exactly what you'd expect from the past XCOM games, EU and EW, so no complaints there. The weapons and armor are phenomenal to look at as well. The art team did a really good job on this game,  The only problem I would say there is is the class system. I am fine with the classes that are present in XCOM 2, alright, don't mess with them. I am, however, disappointed with the way the classes, such as Psi and MEC class, were handled. I can forgive the MECs not being present due to the fact that you're a resistance, not a military. It would make sense not to have high tech military walkers, but when you need to have a PSI operative start from level 1, and you can't use your badass you've built up the entire game, that kind of makes me wonder why I even tried to get a PSI Operative in the first place.   As it is I would give XCOM 2 an 8/10. Hopefully the DLC will add a new, interesting character class with new missions, weapons, armor, etc.",

            "review_text": "XCOM2 feels like a theatrical rebellion against an unknown alien federation who have enslaved the world. The game looks beautiful and the presentation is top notch right off the bat, whether you skip the Tutorial missions or not. The first (or second if you choose the tutorial) mission will remind you of the same unforgiving gameplay present in XCOM: Enemy Within/Unknown. It still isn't quite as difficult as its grandparents, and that isn't really a bad thing. Watching half of your squad die while walking off the Skyranger didn't really make you feel like an Earth saving super team, and should be remembered when facing this game's difficulty. It is unforgiving in its own right, and rightfully so based on its past.   The squad customization options in XCOM2 completely overtake anything in previous titles, and will allow you to create almost anyone you wish (with mods adding even more to this aspect, but more on that later.) The gameplay is presented and flows in a much better way than XCOM: EW/EU. The action camera returns, bringing you on to the battlefield with your created units and joining in their revenge against the aliens.  Absolute victory is no longer required as it was in EW/EU; and failure in missions will set you back, but not ultimately lead to a game over. I appreciated this as I felt like Ironman playthroughs of the first new title got stale after one mission failure in Classic difficulty lead to complete annihilation.   The turn limits pressed me into a specific way of playing, and although I initially found this exhilirating... I found that without them the game was far more exciting even. I personally believe that they could be re-imagined so that timers on certain missions would only begin to count once the new concealment was broken.    The best example of this were the UFO landing missions where you only had to face the countdown timer once the enemy spotted you.     I have heard the complaints about performance and crashing issues; I have been lucky enough to encounter close to none, and the game has run even better since the hotfix. My machine is 8 years old, and hardly matches the maximum requirements.   With the modding built in and an already solid game to build from, the excitement of each new campaign only builds, as my second wave is constructed off of said mods and the experience of the first. To me, this is an improvement over every aspect of the original (new) release, and is already one of my favorite games of the recent generation!",

Now for the actual review. This game is a true sequel. The developers have listened to their fans and have gone to great leangths to give them what they wanted. The gameplay has been improved upon, the graphics are beatiful, the customization options are incredible and all of this isn't even taking into account the sheer amount of mods one can use for this game.  You no longer have to be guess whether or not you can see an ememy if you move, the game tells you. You no longer have to memorize spawn points on maps, they are random. You no longer have to deal with tedious ufo sky play, they took it out. (though there are romurs of an expansion that will bring them back)  The greatest part of this game is that you can make it yours. Don't like a feature? There is probably a mod to take it out. Wish there were more weapons? I can't even count the amount of mods for that. Wish the UI was just a little more refined? Guess what, there is a mod for that!  This is all I want to say without spoiling the story.  All in all XCOM 2 is one of the greatest games to exist.  9/10 without mods 10/10 with.  This game is a must own if you are a fan of turn based strategy games!",

I have played around with the settings and it is a hit or miss. #3. Black screen error. Like all of the sudden the entire screen goes black. No idea why.

            "review_text": "A Spoiler Free Review I make reviews of games I purchase, especially the games that I spent in excess of 10 hours getting my fix of caffene and explosions. *grips his coffee mug like a crack addict*  I prefer to put my reviews in 'Overview', 'The Good' 'The Bad' and 'Conclusion' format.    Overview  The hype train was going full steam and the breaks were carefully removed and discarded with scorn. Leading up to this game, we had heard amazing things and this was the very first time I have ever heard of a community largely accepting a studio's decision to postpone launch by 3 months. Partially, I think, because they actually delivered on time. The first X Com made by this studio was generally accepted as a worthy remake of the original game (though some purists felt too much was lost and too little was gained), and this particular game stood up to the behemoth that was X-Com 2:Terror from the deep. It released on time with a bizzare release schedule that no one understood (and many people bypassed with scorn thanks to VPN clients) and I, just starting my vacation between contracts, dedicated way too many waking hours to it and ruined my sleep schedule as a result.   Disclaimer: I pre-ordered this game. I don't know anyone who worked on it.    The Good: There is a LOT to list here. It's graphically beautiful and it's pretty clear the art team attacked the challenges of making this game like a rabid dog. I will have to separate this section out so it's not a wall of text.  Gameplay: The devs had a working mechanic and they stuck to it. Taking examples from the previous game and expanding on them in a huge way. There are many more powers that involve multi-round effects, many old powers have been toned down while new ones really make things interesting on a whole new level. The new classes are very diverse and work differently (mostly) from their old counterparts. The only one which feels and plays roughly the same is the Sharpshooter, though you won't have an 'In the Zone' map cleaner like you did in the past... sorry folks. Needless to say, even on normal mode the game was a challenge, the enemy has WAY more toys at their disposal and it makes for a far more dynamic game. Psionics are handled amazingly and are a LOT of fun  The Story: We all know the basis of the game is 'you lost the first game bad, this is the result'. The story had me gripped and wondering, and considering the last several games I tried to play had utterly horrible plots, this was like cracking open a lovecraftian novel after reading childrens stories. The mystery kept on going right to the very end. The writers deserve a lot of credit.  The Enemies: Wow. Every time a new alien enemy appeared my response was a mix of 'Holy ♥♥♥♥ that looks awesome' to 'Oh god I am gonna die.' While there are a few aspects that are repeated (andromedan walking animation is the same as the muton walking animation), they all are strikingly unique and all require different tactics to defeat. You will have moments of awe and horror right up to the very end (at least I did). The Elite Muton Day 1 mod was the least inspiring of the new enemies and still looked amazing, so that should tell you something about how impressive the foes are.  The Base/World map: The layout of the base and world map are very similar on the surface and familiar to anyone who played the previous game, but there are critical differences. Your 'base' is randomly placed at the start of the game and you spend very little time there. Your mothership flies around the world from location to location instead of launching from home base. You don't intercept UFO's, THEY INTERCEPT YOU (providing one of the most intense combat situations I ever experienced in the game). Managing the several layers of ticking time bombs, any of which could end your game if not handled right, is a big part of the game as well. You need to ration your time at the start of game and be careful how you use it.   Day 1 Mods: These were fun on the whole. You don't gain much from the Elite Muton aside from a more heavily armored Muton with a fancy helmet, but I don't see any reason to turn it off. The Leader mod I didn't get much of a chance to experience but I probably will in my second play through, but new abilities are always fun and they are all just as diverse and intuitive as the ones found normally in the game. The SMG pack is EASILY the best of the three though, providing a set of great looking items that work in a very unique way and are beautifully integrated into the game. I recommend all of them.     The Bad  Interface: Buttons are tiny, sometimes difficult to select, and if you get impatient you may end up activating the wrong power. When you have large numbers of abilities you run out of keybindings across the top of the keyboard and manual power selection can be tedious.   Slowdown: Yeah this happens a lot. I don't think it's my computer (it's a beast, even if it's 3 years old). I wonder if this is something related to the game as a bug. When slowdown happens, either in loading screens or between powers, it can annoy the hell out of you.   Camera and targetting:I think we all know this. The targetting is a little clunky for area effect weapons and the camera loves to screw with us. It may just be a fact of the engine at this point.  X-Ray vision: Some enemies and even your own troops sometimes can see foes that have complete cover (no LOS at all), and shoot through the wall (or even their own bodies) to get at you. Probably will be patched but it can be annoying as hell.   Bugs: Yeah it has a fair few, it makes you wonder what bugs existed before to require three months of fixes before release. The most annoying one by far is the corrupted save file bug, I had one happen to me on the last mission. Nerd rage.     Conclusion: This game is amazing, and was worth the pre order. If people will criticize it for basically being a remake of the first game, then holy hell they did a great job. The ending was great for setting up the next game/dlc, and we have two upcoming DLC packs to look foreward to.   Final Score: Happy to have bought it and sperglorded over/10.",

Being limited to a few rounds for most of the missions removes every chance of tactical behaviour or even the slightest chance of strategy.  You NEED to rush everything - otherwise you wont be able to finish most of the missions and fail the campaign. Missions get impossible if you encounter larger forces of enemies.. and with the addition of random generated maps (which is great no doubt) - but you encounter random enemies too. So you might find yourself in a match with a massive OP force of enemies early on in the game. I get it.. we are still a small weak group against the massive alien force, but a important mission with 6 enemies which one-hit kill even high rank/equip soldier?   Time pressure can be found everywhere in this game. Too much i say. I mean sure.. i get it that the aliens wont wait on us - but cmon, it's still a game.  Todd Howard once said that the key of making a realistic but still fun game would be to go to the point where the game is so realistic that it just gets annoying and then take a step back to where it is fun again.  XCOM 2 is no doubt a great game - apart from these set rounds you have to finish most missions. I know that there are mods that increase the amount of rounds or even remove them completely. But those Reviews are about the base game - not mods.  I understand that this is supposed to be a hard game. But restricting us to a set amount of rounds is the wrong way to go. If you combine set amount of rounds + ridiculous missed targets + OP enemies + large force of enemies together you just start to go enrage.  I mean.. you basically have to sacrifice 1-2 soldier every mission in order to rush with the other 2 past the enemies, to the mission objective and then sacrifice the other one in order to rush to the EVAC zone.  Which is another thing. Why the heck can't i place my EVAC zone in every mission? Especially in mission where i freaking need to EVAC a VIP. Fighting trough the hordes of enemies to reach the VIP takes up most of the turns i have to do the mission. But no.. i need another 3 if i want to RUSH to the set EVAC Zone.

I'd recommend that people hold off on buying this game until the bugs are resolved.   - Loading times are unforgivable  - Action Camera bounces around uncontrollably and often times focuses away from the action  - Visuals will flash when the map is too big or there are too many units; the best example is the final mission  - character animations will lock-up very often: EG. a unit will run up to my soldier to prepare for a melee attack. The camera focuses in for the attack, and the characters stand there for up to 60 seconds waiting for the attack animation to start.  All in all, the game is still fun.

The AI over and over just deciding to win, which has nothing to do with player input, I hate RNG games with a passion, its lazy scripting and feels like your not really playing anything  the stoopid long time it takes to do anything,   the game crashes,   the optimization even on my 970GTX is offensively bad for a new game,   the 5 minute travel to destination load screens,   the 5 minutes it takes to shut this bloated piece of malware down,   the falling through the roof and alerting the enemy,   the stupid red square system that makes up its own mind on whether the ai sees you,   the stupid way you can be 2 squares away from something like a turret on high ground and not see it through the fog of war, then it surprises your character and kills them.

Im on the 14 hour mark and the game seems to still heavily be on rails with only one possible path forward.   The complete lack of tutorial explaining new features like the waypoints so you have to watch third party input, again lazy firaxis doesn't care.  Well the simple fact is neither you or I should care either. Seriously I'm just getting started this is a one minute top of my head rant, So I say again Im uninstalling this rubbish again until the community actually come out with fixes to all the problems. Or Firaxis man up and fix thier own piece of crap, the only reason Im not getting a refund is I played more than 2 hours apparently, Good trick making the 'tutorial' more than 2 hours, shame the tutorial is just explaining the same game mechanics we already know.  The only good things that are in this game are the elements they carried forward. All the new rubbish just makes it worse. The Long War is a far better mod than this trash. I know there may be mods for all this, but I hate this rubbish they released, knowing the community will fix it.   This game is a worse Xcom than the Bureau, at least that crap worked.

The difficulty is a bumpier ride than most gamers are used to, and if you can stomach the notion of dropping the difficulty (even mid-mission, as is your option), then you can drive over that one.  That's it, those are all the cons.  In the last ten years I can recall perhaps two or three games that I was this satisfied with. When I'd purchased the last X-Com, I was rather bored and rightfully so. It took a year's worth of content to inject that game with enough quality to be great. XC2 is amazing right out of the gate.  The tone is largely the same as the last game, as is the game's feel. A discrete group of paramilitary interests must struggle to resist the occupation of Earth by super evil aliens who cured cancer and AIDS for us. (We'll show THOSE ungrateful turds what happens to the saviors of our species!!)  And so we do. Now we fly an air-whale around a glowing cyan earth map, instead of squatting in a whole and staring at a cyan glowing earth-map. It's largely unchanged. You excavate alien hoard-rooms in your fancy ship rather than boring dirt, but that's largely the same too. (Of note: it's much better polished now in the base because you can click around and watch your soldiers hit on each other in the bar, or fritter away an afternoon having some smoldering purple beams shot into their skull to make them psionic. See that, aliens? We can do WORSE than cancer.)   The staff of your crew are much more verbal this time around, but the conversations are just as aimless.  The real draw of this game, its tactical mode, is why the game is so fantastic. It's fun, engaging, as interesting as XC:EU, and boasts a couple delightful additions to the mix. I kinda wish we could tool with the action cam frequency in-game, 'cause I think that camera is mighty fine but mostly unpredictable. I like watching a dude cut up an alien.  Basically if you're into tactical RPGs, the last X-Com entry, and are aware that game launches haven't had ideal QA since the early 2000s, then buy this game and play it. In this game, dudes cut up aliens.",

Still, even with all its issues I can't deny the amount of fun I've had playing this and that's why it earns a recommendation from me.  However, the absolutely awful performance needs to be mentioned separately. Even though framerates don't matter that much in a game like this, it's still unacceptable for a PC exclusive to be released in such badly optimised state.  GTX 970 i7-4790k 16Gb RAM  Game installed on HDD  The performance is all over the place with my rig. Some settings like ambient occlusion and depth of field actually halved my framerate in some places, I've never seen that happen with any other game. And there's just no consistency, on max settings (no AA) I might get a solid 60fps on one map and then struggle to stay at 30fps on some other map. On the ship and in menus the performance usually stays at 50-60fps, but sometimes makes random dips to 30-40fps. This is also the first game I've played that's made my overall RAM usage go over 8Gb, it's bizarre. The game does look pretty good from time to time, but not that good.",

Wait a few months for the game to get performance patches and go on a Steam sale with DLC bundled in before you grab it, and stop reading this review. I'm not going to sugar coat it: the game is poorly optimized and fairly buggy in its current state. Do not play on Ironman mode unless you want to lose your game to bugs.  That being said, if you can overlook those issues, this game is the classic we've been waiting for. XCOM as a series has always been about balancing risk versus reward, diverting scarce resources, forcing yourself to make tough calls, and having your colonels getting one-shot critted in the face through full cover.  The new mechanic, Concealment, plays directly to that strength. You'll have to decide how far to move before you blow your cover or how much you can afford to move in case a pack is lurking right around the corner. Deciding whether to sneak past a pack can be agonizing, since when you engage another pack later on the previous pack could activate and trap you in a pincer attack.  Whatever you decide, you'll have to hurry. Missions are now timed, forcing you to move fast or risk having your squad left behind and captured. In an interesting twist, later missions will allow you to rescue captured soldiers so they're not lost forever.  The new line of sight indicators next to enemy health bars very clearly let you know what units you'll have line of sight to (and have line of sight back) at a certain position. This is extremely useful when positioning a revealed squad around a pack visible to a concealed scout Ranger, or simply figuring out whether you can line up a shot.  The Advanced Warfare Center building also gives your soldiers a random chance of gaining an out-of-class perk on level up, which can get you some very interesting combinations. For example, a Specialist getting a free hunker down when she hasn't fired this turn becomes an absolute defensive monster you can park closer to the front lines with amazing overwatch.  Veteran difficulty, the Normal difficulty “equivalent”, is no cakewalk. The combination of time pressure and tough new aliens forces you to take your time thinking carefully about every turn. I'm playing on Commander and unless I play nearly perfectly down to the tile, I'm always at risk of losing the mission or a soldier. I can't imagine how horrifyingly difficult Legendary is.  Despite all that I've written, the most important reason you'd want to get this game is to watch your last active soldier's 99% Rupture on a Sectopod miss. The Sectopod turns around to face your soldier, but then you realize too late that it's not a Sectopod, it's been modded into Jake Solomon's face.  “That's XCOM, baby”",

I played it solidly for 44 hours over 8 days to complete a Commander (Hard) campaign, but that was including dozens of reloads. Next up will be a Commander Ironman run, so I'll have to do a hell of a lot better to get close.   A lot of people have had technical problems with the game, but I was fairly lucky. Playing on medium graphics settings I did experience long level load times (1-2 minutes) and some graphical glitches. The whole engine seemed to glitch out on the last misison, but I didn't have one CTD in 44 hours and a reload fixed the glitches. Initially I was disappointed with the final mission (or at least the first two-thirds of it), but the final area was a fitting (and very difficult) finale to a wonderful game. I can't wait for the DLC and I'm sure I'll easily get 100+ hours of gameplay out of this.  Is it the best squad level turn-based strategy game ever? Not yet. Does it have the potential to be the best ever in time with patches and DLC? Yes, I think it does.",

Now before the fans start shouting words of hatred towards this review.. I will say, this isn't a bad game at all. Infact.. it's much more challenging and I would even go as far as saying, it's far better in almost everyway from the previous game. So why the Negative review?  Turn times.. 90% of your missions now have god damn turn times. There's no taking your time setting up ambushes.. no taking your time making sure your squad can overwatch retreating targets.. You have to rush rush rush. For a start you're given no indication of how many enemies are on the map.. just 8 turns remaining, and a whole heap of terrain to cover. It's not tactical combat because we're not given the opportunity to be tactical. Most of my Excellent games have been by the skin of my teeth and pure bloody luck! But it doesn't stop there.. because you'll also have a countdown on your main map as well.. indicating how long before the world is destroyed by the Aliens.   My biggest gripe with the game though is the path finding. In the previous games you could hide behind a wall as long as it wasnt the edge of the wall. This meant you couldn't shoot the enemy, but they couldn't shoot you either without some sort of explosive being used. Not anymore... Enemy's can pull you through a wall, shoot you through a wall, see you through a wall... infact, im not even sure why there are walls :S. Once concealment is gone, every troop on the map is visible no matter if he/she is hiding in a building.. at the back of the map.. sitting in a dustbin... wearing a penguin suit..  So it's not a bad game.. it has allot of potential. It's far far more challenging than EW. It's just lost its appeal for me. I like the tactical, stratagy side of the combat... it's just not fun anymore. That being said I will more than likely complete the game, I just wont be playing it over again and again like I did EW.",

You can never, ever assume that your squad is a pack of badasses who will breeze a mission. If you do the game will be more than happy to present your ♥♥♥ to you on a silver platter. Every decision you make in and out of combat will have ramifications somewhere down the line.   With all that said though once you crack it and begin getting better Armor, better Guns and better Toys you will start to feel on a level footing with the enemy. There is a much expanded tech tree to explore from simple body armor all the way up to powered EXO suits with death spitting rotary lasers.   The best thing about the whole experience though? The Workshop. Simply said the amount of Mods for this game range from simple ini tweaks up to Warhammer 40k Armors, Voice packs for every possible genre you can think of and even expanded hair and skin colors. The game comes with an SDK as part of the package and if you are technically minded your imagination is literally the limit.   On launch there were alot of technical issues but the hotfixes and recent update seem to have banished most of these issues. Is it worth your money? Yes. Will the game make you weep with frustration?

To Returning XCOM players: This game will feel familiar to you, while still giving a variety of new mechanics to play around with. Believe me, it's not just a rehased Enemy Unknown. The difficulty has been ramped up in a variety of ways, including the new Avatar Project timer. Also, timed missions are much more common now, preventing the 'sit back and kill everyone with overwatch' strategy.   To New Players: You will get your ♥♥♥ kicked. Multiple times. Though it can be discouraging to fail a mission or lose your favorite soldier, you can't give up there. That is the enjoyment of the game. It's SUPPOSED to make you unhappy when you lose. Don't be surprised if you lose your first or second playthrough.  Overall, XCOM 2 is a magnificent sequel that, while feeling similar, gives you an entirely different experience, which will be much more prevelant with the new and large modding community. Because of the new mechanics, you will have to try new strategies and adjust to the new gameplay, which is fun in itself. The new emphasis on story can easily grasp you even if you don't realize it. You will not have the same experience in one playthrough that you got from another. An amazing work by the guys at Firaxis.  Good luck, Commander.",

            "review_text": "Looks like a great game. I wouldn't know. After 59USD i can barely play it, and it's not for lack of hardware.  Xcom2 appears to have several improvements upon it's predecessors (EU/EW being the more immediate likenesses). Small things like making items available during the launch/briefing have been improved upon with the ability to build items in this screen, reducing the need to tab back through 'base' locations.  The base its self has been streamlined, although some may not enjoy this change in terms of base building etc... it's not a new and not ridiculous concept. New game mechanics such as 'concealed' and 'spotted; hacking options; a decent customisation of characters and weapons/abilities all appear with the base product, as positive traits of what Xcom 2 has to offer.   But these are all just items in a shop behind a window, with you - the shopper - peering through yet not able to touch the item. At least so far. Xcom 2 suffers from major performance issues at the moment. While some reviews have stressed that the turn-based nature of Xcom reduces the severity of these poor-game-quality markers, they are correct in that a real-time flow would *show* the problem to be more severe, however: gameplay is hindered, hamstringed or outright impossible due to certain aspects / bugs or poorly polished qualities of the game, at present:  *grenade placement just as - if not more difficult - than previous games, feeling like a rudimentary grid-based targeting/aim system rather than a smooth, continuous, x-y type placement of grenades and such.  *moving characters also suffers from this glitchy/buggy placement/registration of mouse pointer location. Numerous times you will move characters into the wrong spot because the registration is offset from where the mouse is actually pointing (with no logical isometric excuse or otherwise). Othertimes you'll be spending minutes to make a single move purely because the game won't pick-up your input at that mouse-pointer location. This is particularly severe when in elevated positions.  * Transparency fails to draw when operatives are inside or outside buildings, and to make matters worse, the camera's vertical motion is capped above the 2nd floor/elevation point of many buildings, meaning that you can't zoom into that room, and even though you cant, the game won't make the building transparent to reveal the accurate and precise position of cover, concealment, enemies and the like...  *Enemies can shoot and otherwise attack you through walls, heavy cover and other types of concealment. This directly works against the strategic/tactical gameplay of which Xcom is based upon. Being shot behind cover is one thing, and though operatives stick out of cover between turns, being shot through a wall while there are no other units targeting you to communicate your position, by an enemy who has zero line of sight on you, is ridiculous.  All these gameplay issues, compounded by the poor optimisation and polish in other regards (such as cinematic and animation stutter/general frame-rate drop only adds insult to injury.  This game can not be recommended at this current point in time due to the state of development and QA that would appear absent given both the price-tag and the franchise name.  I am a die-hard Xcom fan. This game has great potential, but is not worth purchasing. Even to have the game in your library is a mistake at the moment.  Wait for the price to drop or the performance issues to be ironed out.  Avoid.",

There's simply more of everything in terms of choices, but strategically still works quite elegantly. The concealment phase / ambush mechanic was my favorite addition.

Graphically, the game is quite beautiful. Art, design, and story are all great.  But seriously, was this game even tested? The game constantly hangs and freezes. The last level alone was hell on Earth. I was forced to lower settings to Minimal and it was still chugging. Everytime reinforcements came in, I had to pray to Sid Meier that the game wouldn't crash.

Though I had very few crashes other people do get them more often, the 1st patch fixed some of these (and the main one that affected me) and I'd expect after a few more patches over the next month or 2 the crashes and quibbles should be fixed.  The modding support for the game is absolutely top notch, some interesting mods are already popping up which show the potential for bigger things down the line.  Overall, this is a great game with some issues that do not affect the overall enjoyment of the game as crashes for example are not frequent enough to get extremely annoying for most people, and they will more than likely be fixed in the near future.",

            "review_text": "The good: Improved Graphics Easy-to-use Controls Character Customization Various Terrains/Layouts Class System/Upgrades Many Weapons/Equipment  The bad: Bug-ridden Story Online Mode  Summary:  X-Com 2 is a follow-up sequel to 2012's reboot turn-based tactical game, X-Com: Enemy Unknown, developed by Fireaxis Games. It takes place 20 years after the events of the first title, as we're fighting back against aliens trying to take over the human race.  The simple concept of the story is far from one to be bothered to show any interest in. It's one of the weaker aspects of the game, or at least, I just didn't see myself relating to any of the characters or issues at hand. Had the same problem with the first game. Whilst the characters do have different personalities, they seem one-dimensional and the overall plot is just there. The player is the head of the resistance against the aliens as well as leading the ship the Avenger, who of which we never get to see or hear. It's an attempt to immerse us into the role, but since there's no attachment to any of the other characters or critical moments occurring in the game, it's difficult to place ourselves within the X-Com realm.  The soundtrack's there, and there's honestly some good tunes to fight aliens with, fits the setting, but in no time I was substituting the missions with my own music.  The gameplay is where this title truly shines, and is a major step above its predecessor. Turn-based combat is thought of as a tool of the past in games, simulated in a much-quicker pace in the modern era due to the technology available and gamers shifting more towards the action-packed genre than ever before. X-Com keeps the traditional style of turn-based tactical-combat but they manage to make the battles intense and exciting enough to pull off this old style of gameplay. We're given a handful of soldiers at our disposal, multiple objectives to accomplish, various aliens to take down and keep the game from going dull, and upgrades to our equipment and weapons to feel even more satisfied with taking down the extraterrestials.  Satisfying. That word sums up the game extremely well. Perhaps what makes it so rewarding is finally getting a shot or ability to work in your favor. There's an accuracy penalty due to the cover-based terrain that each unit would take cover behind, as well as other factors like armor or ambushes. No one can hit every shot, and that goes for both humans and aliens, just a matter of getting the right angle and drop on your opponent before they do. After a few solo kills or assists on taking down the aliens, your soldiers level up, or in this military scenario, are promoted. Each promotion nets the new class a choice between two decent abilities. That's right, this game has a class system, and it meshes in well, each with role being quite useful for every mission. Sharpshooter (the sniper), Ranger (close-quarters with shotgun/sword), Grenadier (heavy weapons), and Specialist (healing/hacking). There's also a Psi-Operative class, allowing the players to tap into the psychic abilities that aliens use with a soldier of their own. With the different abilities available, it's recommended to make two characters of each class. Later on, players will be able to take six soldiers out on a mission, so mixing and matching the team is optimal.  Speaking of soldiers, there's plenty of customizing. From nationality to voice to personality, color schemes for armor and weapons as well as patterns. This makes the game even more fun as you can make your family/friends, or just about anyone you want, and send them off to battle to do your bidding. It's possible for soldiers to die or be wounded and thus out of action for a few days-weeks depending on the severity of the injury (how much damage they took during the mission), so a careful approach (and having heals) is the best bet to make it through the rough stages of X-Com 2. Equipment can be developed to further give you the edge on the battlefield, such as different effect grenades, armor, ammo, and healing kits.  On top of researching and engineering (the two factors towards upgrading which will speed up if more engineers and scientists are retrieved), the Avenger ship is able to expand its deck and add new facilities such as workshops and laboratories. Each facility requires power, leading the building of power relays. Picking when and where to build the facility is a pivotal part of the game, and then of course making proper use of them. Things were a little more complicated with facility-building in Enemy Unknown, with bonuses to building the same facilities adjacent to one another, etc., but here it's more user-friendly. Quick tip: If there's a choice between retrieving a scientist or an engineer, take the engineer mission. Scientists are woefully underused in this game, only very slightly increasing research speed, ulnless a laboratory is built and even then the difference I halved when it's fully upgraded, and even t hen only two scientists can be active in a lab.  Naturally, there are costs to upgrading. Nothing is really risk-free here. There are two primary resources: Intel, and Supplies. Intel is used in the black market to get mods for the soldiers, extra supplies, etc.. It can be used to learn more about what the aliens are doing with their Avatar Project (a timely event which is our primary objective to find out more about and prevent), whereas supplies help run the ship, expand map prescence, build items, etc.. There are also various minor resources which can be retrieved by completing missions.  This game sounds complex, but it's been mainstreamed to appeal to a larger audience, and that's a good thing in this particular case. It takes elements from tactical-games, RPGs, etc., and blends them altogether in a finely tuned futuristic-army warfare. The number of strategies and ways to take down enemies are seemingly endless, the graphics are spectacular, and the missions keep you on your toes. Some have said that this series is difficult, and whilst they are challenging, it's certainly not on the same level of Dark Souls, Ninja Gaiden, or brutally unforgiving games. For those that like that kind of challenge, the Iron Man mode is available (which prevents multiple save files from being created and auto saves every other turn), as well as harder difficulties.  Online mode is fun, as it pits you against another human player for a change. You can also be the aliens which makes for an interesting change of pace. It's been a little wonky, though, disconnecting issues, just overall unstable for me, but I'll try again in a week or two.  All in all, X-Com 2 takes what made Enemy Unknown good and improves on it ten-fold. Once you jump into your first mission, you'll want to keep advancing and honing your team to destroy the rebel scum. Or alien scum if you prefer. There have been many reports of the game not running smoothly, crashing or facing many bugs/glitches such as units being unable to move, thus giving the game a much lower score. Whilst that is an upsetting issue, a patch or two later would fix all this, and the dev team are currently doing so (two major patches since release to help alleviate these problems). I myself haven't run into any crashing or game-breaking issues other than the loading screen getting stuck twice in the 40+ hours I've put into it. I haven't finished the game yet, on the last stretch and I've hesitated because I don't want it to end. Some DLC is coming along the way with more customizing, weapons, and story. If this isn't obvious already, and given what little time I have for gaming these days: I highly recommend X-Com 2 to anyone. Personalize it however you want to, fight back for your race, and strategically dominate the playing field.",

            "review_text": "After finishing the game on commander difficulty I can safely say this is a great game.   Apparantly, we lost the war in predecessor XCOM 2012 and the aliens have begun to colonize our planet. 20 years later, XCOM rises as a guerilla movement and it is up to the player to recapture the earth as XCOM's commander. Once again this is done by engaging in turn based strategy gameplay on both a strategic and tactical layer; managing the XCOM's base of operations and performing missions with squads of well armed and customizable XCOM soldiers...  - TACTICS - Although not loved by everyone, I believe the changes made to the current XCOM formula made this game a lot more interesting. This time around players cannot simply move from overwatch to overwatch in every mission, forcing them to take risks and make optimal use of the various class abilities. Also added is a nice stealth mechanic called 'concealment', allowing for more tactical options.  The classes have been improved as well, and each is quite viable for usage (get a Psi Soldier!). I also love the environmental destruction, like blasting the floor from under enemies and causing falling damage! All in all the tactical gameplay feels much deeper and dynamic this time around.  - STRATEGY - The strategic layer seems to feature a bit dumbed down and more linear base building. On the other hand, the player isn't forced to build any specific buildings in any specific order to avoid losing support countries like last time. Satellite coverage is something of the past. A mechanic that made XCOM 2012's base building less interesting in my opinion. This time the player can pick their own build order (after building the guerilla tactics school first!), while a doomsday clock slowly ticks away to keep XCOM very busy in finding ways to lengthen its runtime and destroy the alien invaders.  - IMPROVEMENTS - The graphics have been improved modestly, there are more enemy types and the game features richer soldier and gear customization options. The most noteworthy improvement is the improved art style, especially in regards to the design of the totalitarian ADVENT organisation that seems to be in control of the earth (stuff like the unit design, but also some wonderful propaganda material).   There are also more mission types and the maps are procedurally generated. This can create some bizarre situations, allowing for full blown stealth incursions and feeling lots of love 'when a plan comes together'. Many of the missions I was in were tense affairs and the game kept me on the edge of my seat throughout its 70+ hours campaign.  All in all a great sequel to XCOM 2012. Highly recommended game!",

The Support has gone from a don't-bother class to an absolutely critical one. Not having a hacker in your squad means you're extremely vulnerable to dangerous robotic enemies.  The procedural level generation makes for better replayability - you're not constantly dealing with the exact same maps; you always have to learn the level.   You can still completely ignore psy abilities, which is kind of a shame and I really need to get a psy-heavy playthrough in at some point. Perhaps I'm just a bit too inflexible in my playstyle.  Overall - if you enjoy turn-based strategy, an interesting story, and great voice acting, you should definitely check out XCOM2. It's pretty much a must for anyone who sunk hours into XCOM:EW.",

            "review_text": "If you are a fan of turn based strategy, you should give this a try. I preordered this 2 months before it came out, without any mods it ran ok. But then after I installed some mods it was dropping the FPS pretty low, this also being an issue with a line of code using modbuddy adding extra memory that didn't need to be their. With this new patch that has come out it fixed all the issues I had and my game runs smooth like silk now. Now with that out of the way here is my review.  Pros: Great charecter custimization (with 100 new pieces being added with DLC on 3/17/16 with anarchys children) (For me) a great story that keeps you engaged throughtout your campaign Adds more depth than what was in Enemy Unkown and Within  Can create your own biographys for your charecters, (this for me sold me even futher, I love to come up with stories for all my charcters I play in game) Gameplay, while unforgiving, is a great challenge that can be adjusted with mods and lowering the diffculty.  Cons: I would have had more before the patch, but now all I would have to say is that you still need a decent computer to run at high settings. If you easily get frustrated, either this might not be the game for you or this game is going to teach you paitence. There is still some minor issues, LOS sometimes doesn't work properly, not often but just enough were it can put a damper on the game.  The two mods I would say to install right off the bat when you purchase the game are: Instant Avenger Menus and Free camera Rotation. The first speeds up the whole game with things that didn't need to be there. Free camera rotation is a must otherwise you either going to be hitting the E or W key alot while you can just press and hold with this mod and camera will just rotate around. Otherwise, without it, it just rotates 45 degrees at each press. I say this is a great game and definately recomend it. ",

Once the fight starts, it gets really intense on how you use tactics to surround and defeat the alien forces. Sometimes everything will go according to your plan, you will advance your squad, position them and set up an overwatch to cover your other squad members during their movement. But sometimes, the enemy will surprise you, your squad will be flanked resulting in casualties or even loss of your squad member(s), that's the time you switch your tactics to minimize the damage.   Weapon / gear upgrades are also cool. The level of customization on your squad members is also nifty, presents a lot of options. Once your squad starts getting promoted after successful missions, you will start to care for your squad leading on to choosing your best squad members for the most difficult missions.  Graphically the game is also good, nice animations, workable engine with occasional FPS drops, but everything looks good on the battle map.   Back in the HQ, you have a lot of technologies to research, which help you in developing new gear / weapons for your squad. New facilities can be built which add up to your prowess. That can be a little confusing but trial and error will eventually make you understand the ins and outs.   Solid strategy game, i would say, solid tactical strategy game!",

            "review_text": "The second game in the reboot of the venerable XCOM series, XCOM 2 sees the titular organization transform into an underground guerilla resistance movement following an alien victory in conquering Earth.  Gameplay: New the XCOM formula is a stealth element, wherein on many missions the squad begins 'concealed' and can move undetected until a squad member enters a certain radius from an enemy, or is flanked. This neatly emphasizes the whole 'guerilla' aspect of the story, but concealment rarely lasts and is a one-time deal so most missions just fall back to the regular XCOM tactics.   Classes and enemies have been retooled, but shouldn't alienate players of XCOM:Enemy Unknown. New mechanics include melee attacks and hacking, but aren't terribly prominent, being class-specific.   Timed missions also are much more prominent. The player will recieve usually between 8 to 12 turns to complete an objective. I'm undecided as to whether this is a genuine challenge presented in game or simply a way to force rushed decisions and add fake difficulty. They are, however, not everywhere and many missions do not have a timer.   Taking a step backwards in time towards the original XCOM games, maps are now procedurally generated, as opposed to premade as in XCOM:EU. This means every mission is unique and lends the game great replayability.   Story and Writing: Nothing too special. The vague alien overlords of XCOM:EU are fleshed out a bit and the new, alien ruled Earth is pretty interesting, but the story is nothing to write home about.   Visuals: Full Science Fiction, with many cityscapes reminiscent of Deus Ex: Human Revolution. The very vibrant color pallet also helps.   Sound: Sound design is much more detailed than in XCOM:EU and adds to immersion.   Gripes: The aforementioned timed missions, though I can understand why they were implemented so fiercely, given the most successful tactic of XCOM:EU was to simply wait out and ambush enemies.   Oh yeah, and Archons? Why don't you come here AND LET ME SHOVE YOUR BLAZING PINIONS UP YOUR ♥♥♥ SO FAR YOU FREAKIN' MOTHER-EXPLODE!  Verdict: A fair bit more difficult than XCOM:EU, I must say. Newcomers to the series may want to start with that game first to familiarize yourself with overall gameplay and strategies. Otherwise, if you're a fan of turn based strategy, by all means get XCOM 2.",

Granted that I'm a simple guy who is easy to please with games, provided there's what I view as a good story and at least a good attempt at making it asthetically pleasing. I know there are a lot of hardcore gamers on here who will diss a game over the simplest of things, so this review might end up displeasing those kinds of people. Oh well, can't please them all, right?  Anyway, with the expansions they made from the prequel XCOM, it's more of a death sentence to just haphazardly send soldiers without direction. The time limits also give a sense of realism to the missions; strike forces in real life don't run on an everlasting clock. To some degree, it provides a sense of urgency and prompts you to continue moving even if you just aren't completely ready or confident enough to do so.  It's true that there are some things technical-wise that can be improved on. There are a few glitches that aren't game-breakers but somewhat annoying if you're a stickler for games needing to be played without mechanical interruptions. However, there is one glitch revolving Chrysallids which will ruin your current save file; if you are a save scum, don't try to load a game where the Chrysallids have been revealed and burrowed underground. It will forever lock that file with no hope of opening it. I don't know if it's been fixed at the time of this posting, but just a bit of heads-up for you lovable save scums out there!  If you're a person who lets the little imperfections and occasional glitches get in the way of a good gaming experience, then this won't be for you. Although to be honest, there is no one game that is completely glitch or problem free. That and to say you won't recommend it after clocking in over 100 or so hours of gameplay seems like a bad claim to a non-recommendation stance. Otherwise, this game is one I love and would recommend. It allows for easy difficultly if you just feel lazy in the planning department all the way up to extreme difficultly if you feel particularly self-sadistic. It's great for all skill levels with the difficultly ramped up accordingly regardless of what the starting difficulty level is.",

So, when I read the reviews on XCOM 2 I had been waiting and reading reviews for months before the buy. Finally, the game is absolutely amazing again. There is one reason, the game is expected to be hard and to be hard for your strategic and tactical thinking. If you expect fun from killing aliens, go for some stupid FPS. This XCOM, a strategic and tactical game, probably the best you can find around right now.  For example, the claim that time limited missions are too hard and thus not fun. I hate time limitations in games, but this is not time limit, but turn limit. These missions push you forward, so you can't stay behind and play on overwatch. You need to think about time in you tactical decisions and risk appropriately. I was scared at the beginning, but finally found myself mastering new tactics. For instance, thanks to concealment you can go through some of these missions without being uncovered by aliens until the final battle. If you can risk this and do it with precision, your reward is absolutely amazing. You kill VIP, use all of your special abilities in concert and leave the scene unharmed. Taking higher difficulty makes this tactis a need.  Another example, the game is so complex that you simply cannot go through it the same way as previously. The combination of abilities, research preferences or training preferences gives you so significant different gameplay that the game is replayable. Not to mention Ironman feature. Second play is must on ironman. It's not only about difficulty, but it's about the way how you make decisions when you can't take them back and if you know the game, you do only mistakes cause your personal lower patiency. That punish you of course, but that's XCOM!  Guys, don't believe these easy folks who dislike this game, they tend to play easy games and avoid challenge.",

Enemy classes are good, but they seem to progress very quickly in the game thus if you start losing some of your good troops it starts getting extremely difficult. If you lose most of your best troops mid-game I think most people would struggle. Also you have to get the pacing of territory expansion/research right early or you'll run out of time and lose.  My main criticism are missions whereby you have to save npcs, as the game forces you to take great risk and it becomes a game of luck. Generally I let a few npcs die while getting into position as it was the only way to complete without losing a few soldiers. Personally I don't like being rushed in turn based games, but whatever.  Overall a great game and I hope an expansion comes out soon. Could have been longer as once I got the pacing right and kept my best troops from dying it didn't take long to finish. Hardest modes are stupidly difficult as it generally comes down to (mostly) luck.",

In fact the more i start playing this and understanding the mechanics the more i'm enjoying it.  The graphics are quite amazing and the gameplay is easy to learn but hard to master. Voice work is solid as well and with xcom 2 you kinda get attached to your team as they're a small group instead of a massive army. So when a teammate dies you're totally bummed cause of all the effort you put into leveling and upgrading them.  Maybe it's too easy for the hardcore crowd, but if you're looking for a great strategy game xcom 2 certainly is a good place start.",

If you liked the Meld mechanic of Xcom1:EW then you might like this.  Main issue is most missions have a limit to the number of turns you can take - usually around 10. This forces you to take risks which is ok, if that's what you like.   Hacking seems to be a bad choice as failure is so costly that it's usually best not to bother.  Trying to flank is also a bad idea, as usually this triggers another pod. Or, it doesn't trigger a pod but mid fight with your target pod, another pod will stumble in randomly from your own flank - resulting in panic, death, fail.  So I obviously haven't even tried Ironman on this. There are a few game breaking bugs, but also very strange line-of-sight issues. I had one mission where there was a time limit (as usual) and so moved my first soldier up using 1 action. He was instantly spotted by a civilian that I swear wasn't there a second ago. So I reload and there's no civ there...I move forward the same soldier to the same position and miraculously the civilian appears and spots my soldier. It turns out the civ was hidden by a small 1 tile wide bill-board. For some unknown reason my men couldn't see around it. There are many of these line-of-sight issues, which I can only imagine are the number 1 tactical problem on Iron Man mode.  Pick this up in a sale for a tenner.",

Besides, even if you meet the specs, you risk having ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performane all the same because of how poorly optimized this game is. As for the gameplay, I just didn' t feel the magic and tactical depth of its predecessor. My idea is that they tried to change things to make it different, but everything they changed was for the worst: the early game is way too unbalanced, there are too many time-limited missions where you have to rush, mostly into suicide; the setup changed too: you pass from being invaded to being the 'invader', the 'intruder', but i don' t like the atmosphere, nor the 'guerrilla-like' gameplay that comes along with this: you pass from this very deep, scifi-horror-like atmosphere where the 'enemy is Unknown', way more advanced and overwheming, where you have to move slowly and with caution not to be burnt by their futuristic plasma weapons, to being basically a ♥♥♥♥ing dumb futuristic version of a Vietcong. In other words, comapred to its predecessor, its a way worse Xcom, but it' s more hardware-demanding than Shadow of Mordor. WTF??!?! Big flop imao.",

In EU it was too easy to just sit down spaming overwatch, and in x2 this is somthing that is much harder to do. be it having to get to an objective in eight turns or the VIP missons.   Now the VIP missons is probably where the timer becomes an issue for people due to one thing, for these missons you have twelve turns to do your objective and EVAC, any soldiers left behind are basicly dead (they can be saved down the road in another VIP misson but at that point they would be way behind in rank) these missons are stressful, anoying, and are easily the hardest missons in the game.  The thing is, this game is modable as hell. you can easily remove timers, extended them (my favorite) or just make missons easier, or harder.

To put that into perspective, it took 55 hours to beat both XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within, meaning this single game with no expansion gave me nearly as many hours in one play through as its two predecessors combined. Well, perhapns not 'one' play through, given that my first attempt ended after only a few hours, and ended poorly for my pride. Which leads me to the first, and most important warning I can give to a potention player of XCOM 2:  **This Game is Hard**  That being said, this game is also fantastic. Gone is the XCOM of old, the globally supported military elite, replaced with a rag-tag band of veteran soldiers and general miscreants uniting as would be freedom fighters against the alien overlords. Yeah, that's right...all that stuff you did in XCOM previously?? Thanks, but you lost. Sorry about that. And it is never really explained as to 'how' or 'what' happened...but thats ok, because this story needed a setting, and there's always the option of a 'prequel' to explain it all later. (hint hint, as an expansion, not a stand alone game, and for less money than a stand alone, if you please. PLEASE?!)  Anyway, as I was saying, you are now a small band of freedom fighters--effectively a small rebel alliance--and this game makes you feel it. Starting out is difficult, the entire game you feel drug one way then another, and you are never quite able to stop and catch your breath...all of which combines to give a turn based game a very alive and immersive feel. The AI is much improved, and even on lower difficulty settings will gleefully exploit your mistakes. This can lead to some brutal snowball effects, which in turn led me to play my first time non-ironman and to save crawl...something I haven't done in a long, long time. And what is impressive is that I was still proud of winning. This game is that challenging and that much fun.  XCOM 2 also sports strong dialog, a pretty decent story, excellent graphics and cut scenes and very smooth gameplay. Rather than drone on and on, let me try to leave this one simple, which is actually somewhat hard to do...here we go:  THE GOOD -Graphics; challenging gameplay; story line; flashbang grenades (they fix basically everything); fun to play; just plain a good turn based tactical combat game. Basically everything is good. I truly loved playing this game.  THE BAD -it can be just plain hard; snowball loss in the middle of an otherwise successful mission feels really bad; RNG on actions may be a touch 'too random'...missing a 90% shot and then getting killed by said lucky beastie is downright infuriating.  THE UGLY -Central's voice acting when saying 'Commander'. Like, I get it...he holds a reverance for the Commanader that led the initial XCOM project to success against the aliens and    whose capture apparently led to 20 years of alien oppression    but the inflections he uses when saying it makes me feel not awe and respect, but passionate lust. Pretty sure Central wants to be more than friends, and it was a little weird.   tldr Great game. Pretty challenging. Be ready to save crawl or lose a few times. Or both. Now, once more into the breach--time to try ironman mode, because deathwish.",

Loss, thinking of rage quitting, deep breath, focus, moving on.  Back on the global screen disaster strikes, I'm hunted by a UFO, what's this? My ship goes down and I'm left to defend myself with 6 wounded soldiers and tasked with destroying a beacon, fml.   Being pretty new to the game, I charged forward and activated two groups first round at the end of my turn and somehow survived through it with heavy losses. With the remaining 4 heavily wounded soldiers, the only one close enough to the beacon on the hill was Templar so I made a suicidal dash, dodging overwatches to get her to the top of the hill!  Once on top, she revealed a sectoid and two soldiers, and to top it off, a group of reinforcements landed below, RIP Templar... But by some absolute miracle, she was mind controlled! Back at the landing area, Red and two others fought a desperate losing battle against overwhelming odds. As the empty shells from his chain gun pilled up beneath him, his veteran team mates were being taken out, one by one.  Finally it was just Red, dead enemies and friends lay around him with endless reinforcements closing in and no way to get to the beacon. Then, surprise! The sectoid lost mind control on Templar! And with one last shot, she blew the beacon to smitherines! YAyay!! However, just when things were looking up, she was caught in cross fire on the mad dash back to the landing pads. With a handful of enemies still in sight and reinforcements coming, Red was forced to hit the eject and get the ship back in the air.  I knew ironman was going to be tough, but this is just devastating! Central reminds me that I should hire more recruits. I look in my solders' list. 1 gravely wounded soldier, Red, ~25 days.

The unbelievably extensive mod support also promises a ton of play for years to come.  Now, this review was written a couple weeks after launch, and right now, the game does have pretty horrendous performance problems--you might end up just having to disable a lot of graphics options just to run at all. Lots of scenes are choppy, the environments glitch out and randomly fall apart, the game will fail to launch at all if you have anything even slightly out of the ordinary plugged into your USB ports (haha what) and some people's games crash every time certain enemies attack. These are all things that should hopefully be addressed in the near future, and I'll likely update this review as soon as they are, but for the time being, expect a rough ride.

I don't buy a lot of games but this game was exceptional enough to be the first game I preordered and I do not regret this decision  I don't think I need to point out the good sides of the game, so I'll just move on to my negative points, giving potential players and developers a hint about what's wrong:  1) Ofcourse, as everyone already mentioned, there are bugs and performance issues. But I have yet to see any game breaking bug and my HD6870 barely gets me below 20 fps, and that's only when in cinematics  2) Base building plain sucks,with some rooms not needed at all and some rooms which you have to build at exact times, so there is really no choice here, just following the most necessary steps  3) Choosing between missions also lacks depth. You just see a very difficult and 2 difficult missions at a time, and choose one based on which soldiers you have left healthy  4) Difficulty curve is also not balanced very well. I played on Veteran, which was pretty hard on the beginning but was too easy late game. I just browsed, chose my inexperienced soldiers just to make playing fun  PS: Would love to hear it if anyone has any idea about what happened to Dr. Vahlen",

Every single mission, there is a timer and you are forced to rush through the whole thing! Avatar project is the most stupid and annoying challenge they’ve added. Where are the UFO encounters? Throughout the whole game I only had one!  Luckily for me, after finishing the game, a new patch came out. I decided to do a fresh run on hardest difficulty +Ironman but this time I included the mods too. I fully disabled avatar project and all the mission timers, all of a sudden XCOM 2 went from being utterly crap to the most amazing game I’ve ever wanted.

            "review_text": "I've never left a review on Steam before, but I'll make an exception for XCOM2. In the short of it, this is an absolute must-buy for any fan of the prior game, or indeed anyone with a love of turn based strategic combat games.  I'll presume you're familiar with the broad concept of XCOM and this game, so I'll cover some of the notable new features:  - The strategic layer is far more interesting than XCOM:EU. Gone are the random, uninteractive UFO hunts and spending 2 weeks hitting 'scan' while waiting at the base. You'll be given more random map events than you can realistically handle, so you'll have to make choices about which sites to hit. It's a constant trade-off between grabbing the event rewards and expanding your territory to prevent the Avatar project getting out of control. - Mission variety is vastly improved. EU had effectively a single mission type of 'kill aliens', along with terror/council missions (outside of DLC). Now there's a lot more variety and objectives, as well as interesting features such as hacking Advent tech for loot. Some will be races against time, others are the old style of slowly creeping infiltration, or even base defence. - The timers are an excellent addition with a lot of undeserved criticism. The old XCOM style made 'move one tile, overwatch, repeat' the best strategy with no downside apart from Meld. This led to tedious gameplay. The timers force you to make hard choices about how far to advance, weighing up the cost of carefully engaging enemy spawns against the risk you might get bogged down and get left behind.  (a tip if you're really struggling - use a Phantom Ranger w/ Conceal. They can just scout the entire map ahead of your squad, letting you sprint to the end while avoiding pods or at least engaging them favourably) - As to be expected, there's a lot more content. More interesting aliens, more interesting abilities, some great new bits of gear such as heavy-weapon wielding EXO suits and unique ammunition types.  There are a few cons though.  - Performance is terrible. While it's not unplayable, load times are long and fps drops are common. I can run far more visually impressive games than this at far better fps, so this level of optimization is inexcusably bad. - As expected, there's bugs. Teleporting pods, untargetable enemies, a squad member setting themselves on fire when they shoot... I wouldn't recommend Ironman for a while. Nothing that's totally gamebreaking if you can reload, but if you have an Ironman save this will likely frustrate. - There are some odd balancing issues. By 6 months in I've researched every tech available, as it seems that after the Interceptor/Interrogation side of tech was removed they just didn't replace it with anything, so you can beeline the best weapons/armor. Certain mob types such as the new invisible, burrowing chrysalids that can activate and attack on your turn are a bit ill-conceived, even if they are beatable.  Despite the above, I'd still completely recommend it. It's refreshing to see a game come out that isn't afraid to challenge the player and take risks - they could have quite easily released XCOM:EU/EW but with a new coat of paint, but instead they've taken bold strides.",

Some long ♥♥♥ loading times between missions too, even on SSD. Any of this gamebreaking? Not even close. A few compromises in video settings and you will be cruising at 60.

My thoughts are that the game has taken many steps forward, few side ways and a few backwards. The graphics and sound are top notch the style looks much better than Xcom and it has a real good feel to it, great customization and presented well. Cut-scenes seem to have been cutdown dramatically, not really needed but in previous game it helped break up the main story missions from the side missions. You don't get that touch this time, not huge issue but some times cinematics can move game forward.  The micro management on the base side has taken a step back and some side ways and few forward. Now people who play strategfy games usually like a bit of micro-management, not silly wasting time micro management, proper management that shows tactics and thoughts, not wasting time sorting poor design. Well micro management has been simplified, in a few good ways but in some bad ways. The bad ways are the lack of strategy in the base ship, yes you can build rooms in a poor order, but once you have a general idea of the best setup theres not much you can do wrong, theres no different scenerio setups or tactics that you may need to change due to an unexpected event etc. I just felt this time the micro management had moved at all forward which for me was the last games weakness and now a sequel hasnt built upon its weakness. I think delving into this could have broken the very tight dynamics maybe, but its still a shame.  The in game combat is pretty damn good, lots of tactics can be worked, the timer did not annoy me on normal, but now Im about to up the difficulty I am concerned about it. The mod True Concealment is absolutely perfect and should have been in the beginning of the game, timers only start once discovered, hoping this helps on the harder difficulties with timed runs and helps with a bit more strategy. Ignore people complaining about timers, yes I dreaded this when I heard the reviews but really you can still plan well, use tactics and cope with the timer. For me on normal it added to the urgency and made me use better tactics and roles. Scouting out is important. But as before mentioned worried about the harder difficulties, timers could be pain if you get caught up in a early fight with many enemies and time runs down. The RNG is better than Xcom 1 had fewer shots miss then before, never got to annoyed. Some lovely effects in the game, acid burning upper floors and enemies/players falling through and taking damage, some excellent physics and level destruction for a strategy turn based game.  In all I had a lot of fun and looking forward to more mods and trying Ironman. Disappointed at the simplicity of the micro-management especially with PC only release.  8/10 Very enjoyable.",

The whole concealment had me getting myself surounded so i used one or two rangers to spot and a few members just out of sight of the enemy so as to not activate them. Second I would use a sniper to hit from long range. Third i would try my best to pull one enemy squad at a time. I never failed the first few days sneaking around only to have the whole enemy team on my four little troopers.  Great Game  Graphics Awesome  Game play, Like Chess only bad ♥♥♥  Trooper costomization makes each trooper personal, this is a great feature  Works shop has awesome modders doing very cool things. Voices weapons ect. Love IT  After the hard start I managed to finish the campaign.

I have most settings on low and most of the time it still skips every now and then (when enemy reinforcement ships drop in, etc.) and it makes it annoying.  - *edit* I forgot to mention too that at some points in the game some sound clips will be on loop throughout the game. GREMLIN sounds will be constant, engine running sounds being constant. It's annoying.  Otherwise some key points that are keeping me from playing it:  - Soundtrack is amazing.  - I'm all for tactical warfare/tactical RPGs games. - Mod support for this game is astounding but lackluster on it's NEXUS site component which is sad since I mostly go there for modding (when most do as well).  - The game can be quite long and time consuming. If you want a game that you can sit down, play then go out and do other things in life then this is for you.  I'm not adept with graphics, comparisons and all that but I know for sure if I can run a powerful game like GTA5 on max settings then it isn't on my end. It's the game. It has to be.

I'd like to have an honest fight against these aliens, but the game has decided when I discover the aliens they get to move into cover. Combined with the time limit, you're forced to run into bad positions and if you stand your ground you run out of time. This is supposed to add tension, but it isn't any fun to play. I could deal with maybe one timed mission in every four played, but you're forced to make uninformed risks which defeats the purpose of a tactical game.  Technically the game isn't that great either. I haven't had any crashes in the short time I've played, but the framerate is pretty bad most of the time. The graphics look pretty nice but there are some really bad camera angles and sometimes it's hard to tell if the shot you fired missed (it probably did). Sound is probably the strongest part of the game. Most of the voice acting is strong but the main characters are kind of wooden. Bullets, lasers and explosions sound great though.  The story is alright so far, but it feels as though you're almost at too much of a disadvantage. As soon as the 'concealment phase' is over, you're going to be in a heads up fight to wipe out all of the enemies from the map. This is kind of counter to the guerilla tactics you're supposed to using, which says to hit a target quickly and run. A time limit to sprint to the end of the map and then kill all the enemies is not a guerilla strategy. It all just seems a little bit too reactive, when as an underground rebel force with a hidden mobile base I would expect to be directing a little bit more of the action. The choices you make on the strategic map don't seem to matter either.  I might keep playing it and modify this review, but honestly it's probably not going to get much more of my time. I don't usually buy AAA games and now I remember why. I was excited to play this game, since the first XCOM was radical, but this puppy ain't worth the money.",

I have to upgrade to 16GB just to be able to play it smoothly without the risk of crashing anytime I ran out of memory. Do not crank up the graphics as well. Just set it to manageable levels wherein you could reliably render 60+ FPS most of the time.  And lastly, learn how to read and analyse.

You will weep as your soldiers fall to the oppressor and marvel as others step up the ranks. The game pulls no punches even on Normal. Expect to see bodybags at some point during your play.  The concealed overwatch mechanic is a thing of beauty. In most missions you start concealed and can move around freely as long as you don't wander into someone's sight range. This allows for some wonderful ambush opportunities. Position is everything. Do it right and enemy patrols will be erased by a sweet turkey shoot just like Mom used to make.  The Ranger, a new melee unit, glides across the field of battle. They have a blade attack which can be tweaked which allows you to go toe to toe with some of the alien bruisers. They also have an ability which allows them to keep killing after their first melee target dies.  Fair warning there are several missions that have you racing the clock to complete the objectives. I find them mildly irritating on normal sometimes but not too bad. I imagine on harder difficulties that could get down right annoying.  The aliens have some new mechanics too. The thin man has evolved into something else... and its bind attack will have you on the edge of your seat. Can you rescue the captured soldier or would that risk too much of your squad. I won't say any more less I ruin the surprises ahead of you.  The Avenger is a nice twist for a base and very fitting given the guerilla nature of this conflict.

XCOM 2 is still host to an array of bugs and performance issues, though Firaxis has been hard at work on them and I've definitely seen better performance in recent play than in the first week.  XCOM 2 is still maddeningly random at times, just like the previous titles. After playing Hard West, it's something I'm not convinced the genre needs or something that necessarily even adds anything fun to the game. But modding will, hopefully, give us a lot of options towards tweaking the game to be how we want it. It's already quite possibly to do simple numbers adjustments by directing edting the game's .ini files, though I'm not sure how that will affect things in multiplayer.  I haven't been able to get my friends to play multiplayer with me yet, but the setup seems a bit more robust than in EU/EW. That's good, because I always thought that XCOM multiplayer could end up being a lot of fun. I guess we'll have to see, huh?  It's worth buying at the regular $60 if you're a fan of the series or the genre. People who aren't fans of the genre can probably wait until it goes on sale, or may skip it entirely. XCOM, like many games in the turn-based tactical genre, seems to be a love it/hate it kind of game. If you aren't sure you'll love it, it might be worth waiting a bit.

But after playing this, every day I'm playing less and less because quite frankly, the game is broken. They have yet to fix any LOS on buildings / around corners / etc.   It's got to the point where I never can trust the environment. You think you're hiding in a corner of two high covers? Think again. You can't see the enemy but they can see you? Popping pods when you're not even on a corner of a building? All this happens ALL THE TIME.   Then we have the new Geoscape. Ugh. If you like 15 different things all at once, like a smorgasbord of activities to go do and constantly getting interrupted with yet new shiny things popping up AND GO DO THIS NEW THING NOW before you've even scanned one day on your previous new shiny thing you were scanning, then you'll like this.  But OMG, Geoscape needs it's own manual. So many new terms and no idea what you should focus on next. Hey you're the commander, and you just woke up from a 20 year hibernation, they put you in charge without so much as a mouse over tip. It's like you're on the MYST island, and have to figure everything out. BONUS TIME. You get a puzzle in addition to a TBS game! Betchya didn't know about THAT!  Then the voice-over's by central. OMG, If you thought Annette Durand was the most annoying character a game company ever created, Firaxis has went and doubled down! Yes my friends, you get to have someone constantly pausing the game and telling you THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER.   I can't recommend the game in it's current state. It needs so many mods to make this palatable, it's not even funny.",

I've had to lower quite a lot of settings to minumum just to get a semi-constant 60FPS. In larger maps my FPS will drop to 40FPS which is jarring. It's not that important as it's a turn based game, however it is off-putting. The game has an issue with AA.  The game also has odd pauses after some kills of up to 3 seconds where it does absolutely nothing. Miss a shot? 3 second delay. Kill an enemy? 3 second delay. The game doesn't have any flow to it as it's constantly pausing.  Talking heads are constantly popping up in missions informing you of irrelevant facts, like you'll never see trains being loaded or unloaded. Completely useless and can be quite frustrating after a while as you lose control during these speeches.  In the Geoscape, I've had 7 different events pop up in the same day. This constant barrage of game-halting events can become quite a chore to deal with and feels like a job.  Timed missions are frequent. Timed missions are not fun.  Using TAB to switch between your soldiers quite often doesn't include all 4 soldiers in the rotation, it will rotate through 3, begin rotating through those 3 again and then the 4th soldier will be included on the second rotation. It's just strange.  Accuracies seem to be a lot lower than in XCOM EU/EW due to enemies seemingly exclusively using full cover. My low ranked snipers have quite often had a 14% chance to hit an enemy through Squadsight. The squadsight penalty seems to be more significant.  Some of the tooltips for abilties are completely pathetic. The Grenadier ability 'Shredder' has a tooltip of 'Your cannon attacks shred armor'. Completely useless description.  Hold off buying it. Maybe it will be like EU where the original game was just OK, and the expansion turned it into a great game.",

Except in Apocalypse the resistance has their own only singular city to manage/defend.  Customization of solders has been expanded, but don't expect too much as its only a couple of cosmetic items and preset faces.  All the other stuff like base management and geoscape scanning have been revamped as well.  Some gripes are that despite having reached plasma weaponry and going beyond kevlar body armor in the previous games you are back to square one with ballistic weaponry and kevlar armor anyway.

If you play smart, you can have much cleaner victories than in Xcom 1. Xcom 1 has way more RNG problems than Xcom 2.   The classes are better, customization is better, the maps are better.. And again Xcom 1 IMO is fantastic too. So buy this game!!   Also, the missions that are turn limited I thought were great. It adds a whole new element in a really good way. I found that after playing a turn limited mission, non turn limited missions were a lot more boring. It adds extra strategy by basically making it so avoiding fights from time to time is a really good option. It just makes for more interesting and less over watch crawl.   It's not a hard game either. People are either stupid or can't handle a little challenge I guess.   Performance issues for me included on the aliens turn, the moves being loaded slowly occasionally..

This is pro's and con's added for your own judgement with the understanding of XCom Enemy Unknown.  ~Graphics are better and units emotions are awsome. ~Gameplay is more indepth as in RP and customization per squad unit. ~Loading can be long atleast 2x longer then Enemy Unknown when entering mission plus some kinda bugs in cinematic's in gameplay (some spots in any squad loading or mission loading feels like 20fps) ~Nice change in the normal gameplay giving you more tactical feeling of command. ~New game modes and classes, armors and everything compared to a fully customizable character (per ranks) ~Gives you options of creating a unit and saving to a unit pool which you can then recruit ingame. ~ More realisic but reloading a save will not save specialist hack attempts. ~If you are a fan of Xcom Enemy Unknown be ready for the same game but more challange better and cooler abilitys with more to do and some changed to gameplay.

I'll probably have to start over from fresh in about an hour of play. Maybe I'll be able to do one of the missions and set the timer back a notch, but I'll just be delaying the inevitable.

            "review_text": "(Spoiler free) 40 hours+ gameplay &amp; completed on veteran. Heres my option about the game.  The games combat has generally been improved with the conceal feature over EU/EW. Atleast for the first ambush of a fight you are on better footing with your first engagment in a match. AI felt cleaner, didn't have them doing too many weired things. That said weird things happen. For example if you happen to blow the floor from under enough a enemy, and he dies. His body will hover in air, also if he doesn't die. There is a chance they will become buggy. Not show walking / sprinting animations. Just warp to were they were going for rest of match. Also if a player troop gets knocked out and falls. Thier body is not the pick up point, but were they got knocked out. So that feature is buggy.  The games story picked up smoothly from the last Xcom EU title. But could have used more backstory with what happend over the 20 years. An more story on who your research leader is now. Engineer was pretty well done.   Biggest cons:  1. Biggest complaint is the experimental equipment. You can build armors fine, but things for your utilities, ammo and grenades are almost all random on what your going to get. No way to make more with out spending your resources on a rng system. Sucks, don't like it.  2. Dumbed down research tree. Within the first 15 hours of my play thru, I had everything researched expect story missions.   3. The ship facilities were dumbed down. No mechs, genetics labs. You can upgrade the basic facilities to improve manning and outputs or speed. But really no new versions of things like EU/EW. You don't get better power options or coms, ect...  4. For been a big air ship that travels the world. You meet very little UFO, the skys are pretty clear. Every now and than a month special will happen that has a chance to send a ufo after you. But all they do is emp you out of the air and you fight off a ground assault. Guess engineers never thought about putting weapons on a mobile base. That or it was left off because you know, plot boss or lazy boss.  5. The time VIP missions will make you a save scumlord. Main reason timer, for go the steady and careful apporach or else you will run out of time. These missions are a trial and error of moving as fast as you can and sneaking. I finished a few of these missions within 6 turns, others down to last turn out of 12. but really I didn't enjoy it. Wasn't a challenge as more trail and error, reload save.  6. Enemys get stronger with you, but show no signs of why. Thier armor will look the same, but thier stats are as good as yours. Logic, I find none here.  7. Random performace hits. Game normally runs fine, but it does suffer some major FPS issues at times. Espically in transport to and from missions. I have no idea whats in that shuttle that kills fps, but its there.   So in conclusion:  Solid game. Its quicker pace, easier to get into. Combats improved, and upgrades come quick and story is solid. But game is shallow for old xcom fans. Research tree is lacking, engineering is a dissappoitment because of the rng. Lack robotic based troops such has tanks, hover tanks, or mech troops. An no true base / airbase defense yet again.   But I do recommend this game. Game is fun, and what bugs that are in the game will probably be patched out in there near future. Tho none of them or game breaking.",

The client crashes a few turns after encountering them. This has occurred on both of my attempted playthroughs. By that, I mean that I began a new game on two separate occasions and played until I encountered the chryssalids.  2. XCOM 2 has terrible performance and no SLI support. I have 2x GTX 980s, an Intel i7 6700k, 32 GB of 3000MHz RAM, etc. You get the point. Nearly top-of-the-line system I built a few months ago. No reason to have 30 FPS on medium settings on certain missions (I'm looking at you, forest).  3. There are numerous other game-breaking bugs. For example, if you attempt to hack/skulljack an object/enemy near a wall, the hacking screen might display on the other side of the wall, preventing you from accessing the options without blindly pressing the 'confirm' hotkey. The list goes on.  Do not purchase this game until the performance issues and bugs have been fixed.",

The RNG is annoying when, on the same turn, your heavy with a 22% hit chance gets a critical hit and your Sniper with a 90% hit chance whiffs it like a champ. However, that's something I can deal with. I'll admit, I save-scum the crap out of those moments because, in my opinion, that's just BS. Beyond that, I try and play the game in the spirit in which it was intended. The bugs, however, make me want to punch my Mamaw. I love my Mamaw!  So you've spent time prepping your squad before jumping into the first big mission to stall the alien doomsday. You've done a bunch of extra stuff, overprepared even. You spent a lot of time on the global map picking up extra resources and doing the small pop-up missions to level your A-team. You finally accept the main mission and are in the loading screen when.... black screen. 'This program has stopped working.' Load the last save and, after going through the last bit of map tediousness you launch the mission again and.... black screen. 'This program has stopped working.' An hour of research later and you find that you can often load the last auto save from your last mission, finish it, and your next mission will work fine. Then you realize... 'F' me sideways, I'm OCD and deleted all the previous saves because I hate the clutter in the load screen, so I literally and screwed and have to start the entire game over. No way around it.  Since that time, I've had to do that same quick fix of reloading the last auto-save of a previous mission and finishing it because I've gotten black-screened 3 times.  I love this game. It feels like EU/EW with all the appropriate upgrades, including everything from simple UI changes that just make sense and save a few precious seconds of dancing back and forth between menus, to changes in soldier class and abilities that add a new element to your strategy.  I hate this game. Bugs mate me yell at my puppy. Who yells at puppies?! Wait until either it's on sale (because the game is going to be great) or the bugs and crashes have been patched out.

            "review_text": "A lot of people will say that XCOM 2 is more of Enemy Unknown. I can only agree with that to an extent. I would say it's a different Enemy Unknown. A lot of tactics that were employed in the first game will have to be widely abandoned. Why, you ask? Does the change in pace lend itself to effectiveness? Well, I should elaborate.  Narratively speaking, they missed the mark. Canonically, Enemy Unknown was nothing more than a simulated series of events. What actually happened was a full invasion, instead of sending the rookies to fight each other. I only mention this because, when you re-encounter some of the aliens, who have been updated, the original variants are brought up in passing mentions. I have a problem with this because the aliens were more or less just upgrades of themselves. Even if you strike it off as contrivance, the actual plot has its own problems. Starting a guerilla warfare offensive is a fresh change of pace, but I was just never convinced by our team of misfits. I think the biggest problem with the story, without spoiling anything, is the aliens being stupid, and XCOM actually not being far off from being the terrorist group that they're being propagated.  Nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥ about the story because the bulk of your enjoyment will be coming from the gameplay. Let's start with base builder. Fat was trimmed heavily. Your facilities are fewer, the amount of facilities you can build are fewer, but all of them are more meaningful. You could call it dumbed down, but I would rather call it streamlined. With that said, I feel like there's a linear build path. You're always going to want to get your Advanced Warfare Centers and Guerilla Tactics Schools ASAP. It's easier to explain why it's so important to get those two buildings up and running almost immediately, a little later. Research is way less vague as to what you're going to be unlocking by going into research. You also get access to start your investigations into psionics way earlier, which fixes my biggest complaint with Enemy Unknown. The foundry is replaced with the Proving Grounds, which has way better gear available, at the cost that some of it is randomized. Your facilities will also have the option of being staffed, usually speeding up the process of which certain actions are done. The scanning system is way more active, as your base is now on a flying space ship. You can spend time scanning out at places establishing contact with regions, picking up on leads that may lead you to more goodies, or back at your main base region speeding up healing/construction, or gathering Intel (pro tip for pros only: use the medical scan option). The defeat condition this time is the AVATAR project: a meter that fills up that you have to occasionally set back. It's way less punishing than in Enemy Unknown, and that can make the AVATAR project pretty meaningless. They also took out the interception mini game from Enemy Unknown, to the dismay of absolutley 0 people.  The skirmishes are where the game skews in the eyes of everybody; some love or hate the new changes. I think everybody agrees that in Enemy Unknown, it started off hard, and got progressively easier. XCOM 2 is way more extreme and by that, I mean that the game starts off so hard that even the devoted XCOM fans wanted nerfs, and becomes a joke once you overcome the early game hurdle. Alien abduction missions have been replaced by Dark Events. Dark Events will debuff you/buff aliens in any number of ways (e.g. cutting your monthly funding, speeding progress of the AVATAR project, etc.). You get to counter one of these events. These missions will have you coming in stealthily, allowing you to ambush unsuspecting patrols. You could technically sneak by the patrols, but that's a terrible idea, because completing the objective blows your cover, regardless of whether or not you got caught. The missions themselves have timers, forcing you to not spam overwatch. These turn timers are why you get the Guerilla Tactics School and Advance Warfare Center first: you need a bunch of firepower to burn your way to the objective timely, and you're going to take heavy damage. The enemy variety ranges from underwhelmingly weak, to being absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Enemies like the Shieldbearer or Lancer are priority targets, while the new crew like the Sectoids with human endoskeletons (pectoids, basically) or the faceless are gutter trash. Late game, enemies like the Andromedon or Gatekeeper are scary, but by that point, you've probably unlocked your doomsday devices: the stock+repeater weapon attachment combo, and the psi operative.   Technically speaking, this game is probably FUBAR. Frame drops are expected, LOAD TIMES ARE VERY LONG ON THE SKYRANGER, and the procedural generation that XCOM 2 employs gets samey before the campaign is over. XCOM 2 is very open with mod support, and while I never consider mods in my reviews, the existence of exceptional mod support deserves to be acknowledged.   Well, can I recommend XCOM 2? I would not recommend XCOM 2 to the newcomer to the series (start with XCOM: Enemy Unknown. It's the most accessible of the series), but I sure as hell could to the people who loved Enemy Unknown. There are some tough pills to swallow, yes, but I think the experience is worth it.  Final Words: 'Shot failed to connect'",

However there are a few things i did not like about the game. No controller support to me, was pretty big. How do game companies make a game in 2016 not have standard controller support. I turned on my XBOX wireless controller to test it, and it works somewhat, but all the bindings were completely messed up. When you have games like Rebel Galaxy, that come out, and have full functioning controller support, that was created by two people, it is unaccaptable that 2K can't do it.   If you can get over the controller issue, we can start talking about the game. For the most part i found the game to be pretty enjoyable. I was able to beat the game on Normal without too much difficulty. Some people are upset about the timers, however in my opinion, it really doesn't hurt the player. I was always the kind of a person who kept moving, instead of staying in overwatch. Some missions toward the very end became hard, which causes you to take even more risks, which adds to the stress of the game, making it more enjoyable in my opinion.   I liked how XCOM was constantly throwing new enemies at the player, You really had be on guard, when i first laid eyes on the sectopod it made my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tighten. That kind of feeling is very rare in games today. I feel most games are too easy, compaired how they were were in the 90s.   The game is a uphill battle until the very end. Once you develop the psyops characters, it changes the demension of the game. Those characters in my opinion were overpowered, i trained up two psyops characters completely , i could only imagine how it would be if i had a complete team of psyops characters.   But for the average gamer who is looking for a challenging RTS game, i recommend it. Don't expect to win your first time either, because i lost my first two runs before i understood the basic fighting mechanics. Use Grenades to destroy cover, and know how to set up a proper ambush is key elements of playing the game sucessfully.",

Xcom EW was such an incredibly solid game, complaints were virtually always on the player. I broke down after a few days, all the amazing things I saw and heard convinced me. Initially it was a disaster, optimization was so terrible I could barely open the setting tab. Spent about a half hour making hard decisions, and testing the result. My rig exceeds the recommended settings for a PC in everything but processing power, I’m actually .2GHz below required specs. They key I found to fixing my game is to edit the game files. It’s something I always extremely cautious about because I don’t understand programming. I had downloaded a mod that added a new character class (Trooper mod), in the description the designer said you had to delete a file or you would have serious problems. I followed his instructions to a T, deleted the file, and now my game works nigh flawlessly. I’ve had two CTD since the fix, both apparently random and seemingly unconnected.  After I finally got the game running well I have nothing but good things to say. A lot of the bad things I had read about were blown way out of proportion. I haven’t had a single timed mission were I exited on the final turn. It takes some planning ahead, and an excellent ability to prioritize in the moment. Mastering the new ambush ability is critical, not only where to place your troops, but also when to initiate the ambush. For a first play through you should do an easy, tutorial run. It contains story elements you don’t see unless you play it, and is the gentlest approach to the game. After a few missions, and once you’re adjusted to the newer aspects then start a hard play through. If you played a lot of XCOM EU or EW then you shouldn’t have any issues getting used to the controls. XCOM 2 improves upon every aspect of EW. All that said, the game is brutal. This game definitely holds the title for fastest kick in the balls.   The important thing through all of this, is that I never wanted to stop playing the game. Nothing was so glaringly wrong, broken, or unbalanced, that I ever felt like I didn’t want to play it. Sure there have been a few rage quits after my all my favorite characters get wiped out, but after a few minutes of seething fury, I would sit back down and boot it up again. That said, if the developers don't address the optimization issues then I'll have to change my review. Also the fact that there are 289 mods out, six days after release is pretty awesome. ",

            "review_text": "So far, so good. Feels like the old X-Com but with some new flourishes that I'm slowly beginning to appreciate. There's definitely enough new here to make the game feel like its innovating. Much of the renovations come in the form of the strategy base layer where there is a race against a doomsday clock, dark events, and the regular supply woes.  I haven't found the gameplay to be prohibitively hard. In fact, it feels slightly easier than the equivalent difficulty on the original (though again I'm only a few hours into it, having just expanded my world by contacting 'New India' and finishing the blacksite mission there). Haven't gotten the hang of hacking and find the lack of a tutorial/lead-in on the advantages of this facet slightly irritating. Blew my cover once by fiddling with it and not understanding my chances or the consequences of my actions...  Anyway, definitely addicting like the last game. I wouldn't recommend paying $80CDN though.",

The game is all about how the XCOM commander is the key to game, how he is important to both sides, but he is not making any key decisions. The graphics are awesome, the soundtrack, gameplay is a bit tricky when you try to move an unit and suddenly the path change forcing you accept an unit out of cover(dying the next turn) or reloading.

            "review_text": "While I'm only 11 hours in the game so far has been extremely impressive. For fans of the previous iteration I think it's safe to say that XCOM 2 takes away the bad and adds in interesting new dynamics. The biggest change I've noticed so far is the pacing. In the original XCOM, depending on the difficulty, you could spend hours on a single mission. Mos of that time was spent slowly inching your way forward and hoping that you wouldn't activate too many pods (patrols) at a time. They've implemented 'Concealment' which is just what it says, it makes you able to move without detection so long as you don't get too close to the aliens. Paired with this is the fact that pods now patrol along pre-set paths, allowing for less frustration because of random luck. In order to make you play more aggressive most missions have a built-in timer to clear the main objective. If you're not a fan of this there are already mods which modify or remove the timers.  XCOM 2 still has a few quirks, but they are mostly benign. Guns sticking through walls, bullets flying through your squadmate's head on their way to the baddies and other minor graphical issues make for comedic effect, but also hinders immersion somewhat. The biggest issue I've had so far is with Line of Sight (LoS). Just like in Enemy Unknown / Enemy Within the LoS is sketchy at best, and sometimes downright wrong. At times I've been shot at through solid walls and activated pods from insane angles, not to mention the uncertainty of whether you'll trigger that overwatch. It's unfortunate that the developers haven't been able to solve this issue. However this does not take away from the fact that XCOM 2 on the whole is a vast improvement over it's predecessor and brings several fresh and interesting ideas to the simulation of battling a superior alien army. The game sucks you in and time flies, before you know it your eyes feel like they've been scrubbed with sandpaper and you have to get up in 2 hours.  All in all this game is an amazing experience and I recommend you pick it up right now. You won't regret it.  Good luck Commander - You'll need it",

Taking the formula, and turning it on its head, you are now the force in a ship, a mobile base, rather than the enemy. All of the old touchstones are there, however. Research, tactical, squad-based gameplay, and the feeling of fighting against overwhelming odds. Of course there are aliens, though they have again turned that on its head a little as well. While you see some old familar names - and perhaps faces - most of the enemies have been revamped. The little psionic runts aren't so litlte any longer, and are far more challenging to fight. The thin men replaced with, apparently, what the 'thin men' really look like in their native environment, before having had their DNA spliced in with that of a human.  Having said that, XCOM 2 has its share of bugs, which I hope the good folks at Firaxis gets sorted. Enemy capable of melee through walls, firing through walls, and crazy camera angles at times make things a little confusing, and more than a little annoying. That said, it's not enough of a problem to make the game unenjoyable, and hope that they will address these issues in a patch (or two).  While there is some workshop support for this, it seems that there are no officially supported mod toolset (at least, none that was blatantly obvious), which I find unfortunate. That said, there are some good mods out there, and hope to see more in the future. Overall, it's a fun game.",

Once you realize that most early missions are easily completed in 5-8 turns having a timer of 12 is just irrelevent. Have to say that aside from the timers the missions are a pretty nice spread.  The ambush system is nice when they let you use it, with enemy troopers walking patrol routes waiting to be hit. Some missions are throwbacks to the first game (I'm looking at you retaliation missions) where you wade in guns blazing and the enemy gets free movement into cover.  The game still relies rather heavily on RNG until you can develop your troopers enough to be reliable. That the game manages to entertain in spite of this is rather impressive as other games that rely so heavily on RNG tend to be awkward and painful affairs.

The customisation options for your soldiers are great (ranging from gear appearance and colours, through face, hair and skin types to voice and accent/language options) and it isn't long at all before you are feeling very connected to many of the troops.

I will put a 'no' even tho i still enjoy it so that Firaxis understands it's an unfinished product. Apologies for my bad english as well.  PROS - It's a prettier version of XCOM 1, which is pretty much enough on its own - They added the ranger class. You don't need anyone else when you have a ranger. Your ranger kills everyone with hher blade, anytime, anywhere. I think the ranger could kill superman without needing kryptonite.  - Grenades don't have a hit chance. Good. Most of my non rangers use grenades to avoid the RNG, which is completely fake (see below). - PSI kick ♥♥♥ as well. So you do a ranger/psi team you win, period.  CONS - Gameplay is ULTRA repetitive, seriously, play one mission and you pretty much played them all - RNG is absurd. 75% in XCOM 2 = 0,7% in real life. - AI is stupid. Game is very easy, even on highest difficulty. Your only enemy is the RNG. I do most missions without one single soldier wounded. - Hit chances are not based on the % that is written on your screen but based on what you did during the round. This is stupid. For example : you have 94% chances of hitting a mob but if the game decides that you don't hit it (and you can often miss with 94%) then you can reload as much as you want, you will still miss. The only thing you can do to change what happen in your round is to reorder your actions (like dude B fires then dude A fires instead of A firing before B and, voila, both hit). - The campaign is crap, it forces you to play missions over missions without leaving you any freedom because of game over doom timer and multiple forced events that you can't evade because... Well you don't know but it's very bad if you don't do them. This is a real bad choice from firaxis - Central voice over gets old VERY FAST. Yes i know that civilians are dying, i've understood it the first 99 times you told me, ALREADY.  ",

            "review_text": "I enjoyed XCOM 2 quite alot, mostly because I played quite alot of XCOM: EU, EW and the Long War mod. The game makes some pretty good improvements over the original while, managing to stumble on few of the new things.  Now I am simply gonna state some things about the game.  - Perfomance &amp; optimization is bad. I run GTX 560 Ti. Max &amp; High were unplayable. Medium &amp; Low took heavy hits every know and then. Even after turning off most of the luxury graphics, the game had extreme issues. Even few additional particles in a map would start causing performance drops. The overhub was no better, the mere action of going to the geoscape causes a performance hit. This kind of stuff needs to be fixed, there are no excuses.  - Enemy desing had both good and bad. Enemies with always always ready teleport abilities that they can use to auto-flank you are not creative or strategic, they are pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. First time meeting a new enemy needs to be a surprise, but after that, not so much, this game is about strategy. Hidden enemies were a nice addition, there could have been more tools to dealing with the though. Too many enemies seemed to have incredible movement ranges, to top it off, most of them even had quite large HP pools, armor &amp; defensive stats. This made damage dealing methods that did not rely on chance (Explosive, Psi &amp; some others) something the player needs to hoard, otherwise they would not be able to deal with most enemies in the game.  - The gameplay outside of mission was quite pleasing, the change was nice from XCOM. It made you work quite hard, so you don't fall behind the aliens in power &amp; progress. The resources you had worked quite fine, though some of them at times seemed quite redundant as you had nowhere to spend them and by the time you need them, you have too much. The black market could have been a lot better. You should have been able to make request for a small-medium payment in order to have something to look forward to when visiting there.   - The proving grounds annoyed me a little. Having to rely on RNG to make the best items &amp; tools in the game was a little bit akward. Weapon modding is one of the games highlights, so why the hell am I not able to gain access to the, mods trough anything but drops &amp; shop, which BOTH rely on RNG. Even worse, some of the mods are completely stupid. Instant kill mod? Additional move mod? Misses deal dmg mod? What? Those are completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ concepts in a game of strategy &amp; chance. I don't want mods that introduce more RNG, I want mods that are able to tip the scales in my favour trough the choices I make. Bipod? Grenade tube? Bayonet? Why is holo targetting still a skill no one will ever pick, not a mod?  - Mission were extremely nice. Timed missions at first hard, but after you got the hang of traversing the terrain, scouting the areas and knowing which pods were worth it to break concealment for, the missions became very very interesting. (Thank the heavens for specialist scanning &amp; battlescanners) VIP &amp; Dark VIP rescues were a bit annoying, the player should have been allowed to choose the spot for EVAC atleast in the mission where the VIP had to be rescued from a room/cell/van. Could have balanced it out by making the evac square require a bit more free space.  - Character customization is good, I expect to see more stuff added by both Firaxis &amp; modders.  That is all I can think of now.",

I've only played a handful of missions and just started upgrading my command center, and will update my review later on. So far I'm impressed with what I've played. The game is tougher, no doubt, but the complaints about the timed missions surprise me. Unless you play a spectacularly cautious game, they're not so quick that I felt terribly rushed. The early difficulties are here in abundance, but just as was intended, they make victory that much sweeter. Most of the changes are very welcome (overwatch not triggering after an opponent's death, or the sectoids being tougher and more menacing). I haven't enountered any negative changes so far.  There are complaints about performance, and they're valid. I've had my share of hitching and bizarre, prolonged pauses, and framerate drops, but the game never crashed. I can only assume these will be patched out.  Again, I'll update this as I gain more experience, but if you loved the previous game and it's expansion, I have little doubt you'll enjoy XCOM 2.  8/10 (Points off for performance issues)  Update:  Review Update: Performance issues are REALLY bugging me now. It's been a bit since the game launched, and none of the significant ones on my machine are fixed. Read some developer comments about 'not noticing' any of the issues before launch. That's either B.S. or the testing they did on different configurations was tremendously limited. They're too severe to 'not notice.' This comment and the continued problems are both ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. 6/10 until they are fixed.",

I can sort of understand why people are raggy about the turn timer, but on my current playthrough (admittedly unfinished) I reckon somewhat over half the missions are timed, and I think it makes for a refreshing change of pace. EU rewarded extremely defensive tactics, and like most other people, I spent ages crawling across the map at glacial speeds, hopping from overwatch to overwatch. It's good to have a more aggressive approach rewarded.  As for the bugs, I can completely understand people being hugely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off if they can't get the game to run and I do sympathise (I had the same thing with EW, which was massively rage-inducing). It's running fine for me though - the odd bit of lag here and there, and a weird glitch where if a Viper binds one of my rangers with the Blademaster ability, the vViper will die a painful death, but my ranger stays locked in the 'being bound' animation for the rest of the mission. But even while it's glitching out like this, it still runs, odd though it looks.  Anyway, too much good stuff to mention - concealment works brilliantly, strategic overlay and base building much improved, it looks fantastic, soldier customisation is great. I can understand holding off if you think your systen might struggle with it, but really, once it's patched up a bit, you have to buy it. It's one of the best games I've played in years.",

I'll be covering the ♥♥♥♥ things exclusively in this review.  My main gripe with the new XCOM is the 'Avatar Project' Basically a race against time which fills up and means a game over if all bars are full. Holy ♥♥♥♥ it's a real race, what with the only means of stopping it being several territories away, and combined with the fact they actually LIMIT the number of regions you can have... It really feels impossible. I actually celebrated when one of my territories went under because it meant my regions went from 6/7 - 5/7 meaning I could delay the Avatar project and not get game over stupidly quick.  Another gripe is these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ aliens which ♥♥♥♥ around with cover and generally don't care whether they die as long as they kill someone. I mean, COME ON. I had a bum rushing alien which rushes to melee kill one of my squad mates, and then immediatly gets killed. Y. There are also a couple of aliens which negate cover. Oh boy, I really love my formation being flipped over and ♥♥♥♥ on because these O.P aliens can either jet through walls or reach through a solid object. Why you ask? I asked the same question. All of these elements combined basically cause you to save ♥♥♥♥♥, because the game starts to feel unwinnable if you don't.  BUT I'M STILL RECOMMENDING IT. I have a feeling a made all these novice mistakes with planning and that ALL of these problems could be fixed if I invested in the planning stages more carefully.] And the game is fun anyway. All in all, I like it. But as oppose to some games where you think, 'Should have seen THAT coming' XCOM 2 makes you think 'How is that even possible?' honestly devs this needs balance stop vipers reaching 12 lightyears away through 2 walls to drag my guy though those two walls to strangle him.            maybe this is me reaching out saying 'normal is too hard' yeah that might be right",

The overall feeling I got from the game was 'weird' and the story isn't much better either (What the F happened to Bradford?!) The missions lack variety after a while and the timers are not neccesarily a welcome addition, except for the hard core players. But where xcom:eu delivered a far better, somewhat arcade-ish experience, Xcom 2 is focussed much more at the tactical layer at the cost of the overall game experience. There is for example no real base manegement and the UFO hunts have been eliminated from the game. The random maps make it impossible for the A.I. to set you up for a trap when exploring rooms. In Xcom:EU you had to search rooms and buildings and behind every door was the fear of an ambush lurking. That is completely gone now.  The commander difficulty was rewarding but I felt the game was cut short with the final mission. The 'Legendary' difficulty setting is a joke. The AI cheats on you and percentages are off. The procedurally generated missions are boring, short and dull and I'll take XCOM:EU maps over any procedurally created map any day.   Visually it is a game but again it lacks the enticement here. There are for example no fancy cutscenes when assaulting mutons barehanded that felt so rewarding when watching. Also the somewhat comical tone of XCom:EU is gone and the dev crew tried to make the game look more natural. In which they have succeed but again, at the cost of something good. The slight comical tone of XCom:EU added more drama to the story.   In general, I feel XCOM 2 was rushed and released to appease only the modding community. It feels like a present to the modding community to thank them for extending XCOM:EU with the LW mod. I also highly doubt if the dev's are really satisfied with the result themselves. Imo, theres a line in how much you listen to your fanbase and change the course of their own vision of how their game should be. In this case, that line has been crossed and the result is a 'game' that's barely worth calling a game, considering how fast you can finish it.  Fans of XCOM should however buy this game because there's nothing else right now to quench your thirst for TBS gaming and maybe my review is a bit harsh but I was really looking forward to the sequel of one of my all time favorite games.

The game still features RNG that is well known (for better or worse) in the XCOM franchise but is more balanced at all stages. This is still a challenging game XCOM fans have grown to expect in the franchise but has a more 'fair' feel. The mobility of soliders in XCOM 2 creates more interesting battle maps but beware of crumbling structures.   The doomsday clock (count down to end game) is not well explained. If you are aware of the mini game it is very easy to min/max you time between stages but this is not explained well in the game. The first play through can be confusing and lead to virtually impossible games. Once you understand the doomsday clock mechanic the game becomes MUCH easier.   Pros: Builds on the success of XCOM 1 (I recommend starting with the prior game before buying XCOM 2)  Cons: Enemy AI is slightly worse in Enemy unknown. The game does not adequately inform the player of the doomsday clock minigame before it becomes to late on an initial playthrough.",

            "review_text": "I'm writing a new review now that I have had a chance to try the Alien Hunters and Shen's Last Gift DLCs.  TLDR: Great gameplay, very well designed, but buggy as hell...play at your own risk.  I think the thing that bothers me the most, and ultimately prevents me from even considering a thumbs up review, is that there are some of the same bugs as were present in EU/EW. The bugs range from graphical glitches (stuttering, delayed effects, discolorization, etc) to game-ending if you're playing Ironman mode. For a game that is intended to be a hardcore strategy game with an Ironman mode, there are simply too many major bugs present. Here are a few of the more annoying bugs: - Walls/ceilings will sometimes be transparent to gunfire, but you won't know until an enemy shoots you through it. - Units occasionally change floor level within buildings (rare but can be bad when it happens) - Graphical stuttering can cause you to click on the wrong tile as things shift suddenly - Timing of events can get out of whack such that events occur that should not. For example, one ability gives you a free melee attack against any enemy that approaches within one square. This reaction attack should occur before the enemy unit has a chance to attack, but sometimes it gets delayed and the enemy gets an attack in first. - Masses of dead, flying, flailing robot bodies prevents player from ending turn. Amusing to watch, but frustrating because reloading to an earlier save in the same mission  does not fix the issue . I will note that this is an issue specifically with Shen's Last Gift, so clearly they spent too much time making DLC and not enough making things work properly. ...and many more!  So what's good about the game? Well, if you have a high tolerance for bugs, the gameplay design is quite good. I have definitely rage-quit for extended periods of time after major bugs kill a session but when things are running smoothly there's an amazing game hidden beneath the bugs. Both the DLCs mentioned above provide new interesting gameplay material that, if they weren't riddled with bugs, would be very compelling as DLC.",

            "review_text": "XCOM 2 is a turn-based tactics game developed by Firaxis and the sequel to XCOM.  This time, the tables have turned. Humanity's defeat is the canonical ending to XCOM, with the aliens taking over Earth. 20 years later, what is left of the iconic organization is brought back together to fight a guerrilla war against the Advent coalition, in order to free the World.  You have to manage the organization, like assigning different research projects, constructing facilities, building items, handling recruitment and your soldiers equipment. In the tactical map, you begin with only your starting region and have to establish contact with the local resistance in other regions in order to unlock them and increase your income. You no longer have to worry about losing the game for having too many countries leave the XCOM project, but instead you now have to deal with the Avatar project, the aliens response to your organization, that if left unchecked and completed, means game over.  There are still four main soldier classes, which are similar to their previous counterparts. The main differences are that rangers, in addition to their previous assault abilities, are now capable of performing melee attacks with a sword, and specialists are now able to hack devices or robotic enemies remotely, with the help of their GREMLIN drones.  The turn-based tactical battles went through some important changes as well. The maps are now procedural generated, making every engagement feel unique. In most missions, you start concealed, which means enemy pods won't get into cover when you see them, provided you aren't in their line of sight. You are able to set up ambushes, and since you are a guerrilla fighting a well established foe, enemy reinforcements can be called into the fight and many missions have turn limits. If you fail to complete the mission within the limit, depending on the mission type, you will either fail the mission completely, or have your unextracted soldiers captured. Captured soldiers can be recovered in rescue missions later on. Combat can be extremely harsh and frustrating with the dice rolls, but with good strategic and tactical decisions, you are able to minimize the need of luck in the outcome of your missions.  The graphics are good, with an overall clean presentation. The soundtrack is enjoyable, even though I miss the previous game composer Michael McCann's musical touch.  In the end, XCOM 2 is a clear improvement compared to its already solid predecessor, as it was able to keep all its strengths, but also improve on some of its glaring shortcomings and I highly recommend it!",

            "review_text": "I won't write a long review as all the details you might desire can be found in other reviews.  Bugs: First up - there are some bugs, in my experience all minor glitches with graphics, with just one exception. One early unit can reposition one of your soldiers with an attack (the snake/tongue) and that may put the soldier into a weird spot - they haven't got the code for where to drop the soldier quite right. It hasn't caused me any problems - it's just weird.  If you are the kind of person who will find it hard to enjoy the game with some minor graphics glitches - probably best to leave it for the first major fix patch.  Design: It's Xcom - the gameplay design is consistent with Xcom EU/EW - with one major change. There are missions (particularly early in the campaign) with objectives to be met within a certain number of turns. These mean you have to adapt your strategy to meet the objective. It does mean that the gameplay here feels quite different than in Xcom EU/EW ... IF you were a defensive player. If you were an aggressive player, it won't feel very different. I was a defensive player - I have had to learn a different approach here.  If these time limited objectives will stress you out and make the game unfun - then either give it a miss, or subscribe to one of the mods in the steam workshop that modifies or removes the timers. Personally I expected to find those timers very stressful - I HATED the first bomb mission I faced in Xcom EU. But, having adapted my gameplay - I find them very good indeed - they add an objective and a challenge and make the fights different.  That's the bad news ...  The good news - it's awesome.  It's already given me a gaming moment that will live with me for a long time. There is more of everything - and it's all great.  4 months and 250 hours of gameplay later - and the game is still highly enjoyable to me. I only play ironman and have not encountered any of the game breaking bugs that are supposed to ruin my experience. The new king / queen bosses are great - a completely different challenge, you have to learn to adapt your style for them fast. It gets better and better.",

Pros: Customization of soldiers/weapons/ship - They took the last XCOM and just improved. New engineer/scientist system - Makes engineers and scientist seriously worthwile especially early game. Ship vs base mechanic - I prefer the ship in XCOM 2 to the base in XCOM: Enemy Within by far. Concealment - Adds a whole new emphasis on strategic placement in the beginning of most battles. Specialists - By far my favorite class. Adds a new emphasis on support that is also a highly capable combat unit. Carry mechanic - The ability to carry wounded/dead troops off the field is absolutley awesome.  Cons: Bugs - Lost multiple soldiers to stupid bugs. Nothing game crashing so far. Forced retreat mechanic - I like to play out missions and use tactics etc, but in XCOM 2 the majority of missions force you to get somewhere within a certain amount of turns severely limiting most tactics and turns most games into a rush. Avatar Project - I don't dislike the story line. I dislike the speed at which the Avatar Project gains progress. I like to run around and do as much as I can, but with this I'm constantly being forced to gain new sectors and find their bases, not support my allies and my own soldier development. Dr. Tygan - He just bugs me.  Things I'm on the fence about: Accuracy - If I have a machine gun and I'm standing 5 feet from you...I'm not going to miss, yet somehow XCOM soldiers only have a 70-80% chance of hitting you. Accuracy - If I have any gun and I'm 5 feet from you. I'm still going to hit you. 100% of the time.  All in all the speed of the game really turns me away from playing through more than once. I want to have time to build a resistance force and fight an occupying power. Not run after individual bases constantly. Other than that I think they took a lot of input from the previous XCOM and improved a lot of systems and game mechanics.",

Set 20 years after you got your butt handed to you in XCO:EU, you must now lead the rag-tag band of rebels who hijacked an alien transport and strike the aliens from the shadows as you uncover the sinister secrets of the Avatar Project. (No, blue cat-people aren't it.)  If you've played the previous XCOM, you know what to expect. If not, XCOM 2 is a hybrid turn-based tactics game/base and resource management game. You go out, shoot aliens, take their stuff, and use that to build new weapons, armor, and facilities to go back out there and shoot more aliens. At least, tat's what you want to do, but this is XCOM. And XCOM has a reputation to maintain, so expect the aliens and there human...ish collaborators ADVENT to put up a fight.  In all, the game is more XCOM, and while the tactics part has been improved, the stratgy part is a little... off. It feels more like a board game than the previous game, and the addition of an unstoppable Doom Timer, which you can only set back, but never stop adds some stress to the formerly safe part of the game. The tactical missions also gained turn limits, some more generous than others, which can come as a nasty surprise if you're used to a more careful approach.  One big shoutout has to go to the above the call of duty mod support Firaxis is offering here. When you download the Develeopment Tools, you get ALL of the game.

The timed missions put just the right amount of pressure on the player. You can't just set everything up perfectly and methodically break the missions down.

I discovered the first game in the reboot about a month ago and ripped thru it like butter. This is not butter... this is steak and requires EXTREME amounts of pacing to dig into the meat. Positioning is your knife and patience your fork. The last game was all about moving your squad in a line very carefully revealing segments of the map and making sure no one is in a dangerous place until you encounter the enemy where you can just turtle for the win. The big new feature to the table is concealment which allows you to run into enemies as long as you are out of field of vision. This allows for high risk high reward ambushes and setups to quickly route enemies before they can even attack. Sounds even easier than the first??? Wrong..... dead wrong. This is sort of a 1 time thing on each map(some abilities can extend this) where all other engagements play out like the original. Again the game places huge emphasis on when to play/reveal(lol) your hand. Enemy scaling, character abilities, tech tree unlocking, rng rolling, and damage outputs are all nerfed and pose quite a kick in the balls challenge. In the last game it was easy to recover from bad decisions, multiple characters dying, poor resource management, heck there pretty much wasnt anything you couldnt come back from (fyi I'm talking iron man mode, the only way to play). In this however it becomes rather apparent whats essential to race to and what to hold off on. This might bum some out because it doesnt really allow for experimentation other than countless game restarts; which is still fine and fun, it took me at least a dozen campaign restarts to get the feel of what I needed to be doing and even still now I feel there are areas I can flesh out more potential. Every map things can go from 0 to 100 real friggen quick and even if you survive the map, whats left over wont be enough to finish the next. Its all a rush and it never lets up or cuts you ANY slack. Graphically its very pretty to look at, zones are more out door-sy an varied, the aliens are way less cartoony and more savage looking, effects and combat also get a facelift in the intense scale. The story well isnt as cliche/straight-forward as kick aliens off the planent but its still pretty much kick aliens off the planent lol! The multiplayer is still something I havent touched so I cant say anything about that. Basically this is a tougher more refined XCOM Enemy Unknown. Its turn based strat at its perfection with hours upon hours of screaming, cheering, and gasping as you watch your squad and yourself make life an death decisions.",

Bugs: First up - there are some bugs, in my experience all minor glitches with graphics, with just one exception. One early unit can reposition one of your soldiers with an attack (the snake/tongue) and that may put the soldier into a weird spot - they haven't got the code for where to drop the soldier quite right. It hasn't caused me any problems - it's just weird.  If you are the kind of person who will find it hard to enjoy the game with some minor graphics glitches - probably best to leave it for the first major fix patch.  Design: It's Xcom - the gameplay design is consistent with Xcom EU/EW - with one major change. There are missions (particularly early in the campaign) with objectives to be met within a certain number of turns. These mean you have to adapt your strategy to meet the objective. It does mean that the gameplay here feels quite different than in Xcom EU/EW ... IF you were a defensive player. If you were an aggressive player, it won't feel very different. I was a defensive player - I have had to learn a different approach here.  If these time limited objectives will stress you out and make the game unfun - then either give it a miss, or subscribe to one of the mods in the steam workshop that modifies or removes the timers. Personally I expected to find those timers very stressful - I HATED the first bomb mission I faced in Xcom EU. But, having adapted my gameplay - I find them very good indeed - they add an objective and a challenge and make the fights different.  That's the bad news ...  The good news - it's awesome.  It's already given me a gaming moment that will live with me for a long time. There is more of everything - and it's all great.  4 months and 250 hours of gameplay later - and the game is still highly enjoyable to me. I only play ironman and have not encountered any of the game breaking bugs that are supposed to ruin my experience. The new king / queen bosses are great - a completely different challenge, you have to learn to adapt your style for them fast. It gets better and better.",

Nothing like missing an alien then hearing it ping somewhere in the fog of war followed by the death of an Alien. I miss those little things in games...

            "review_text": "Love it, hate Alien Hunters DLC.  Positive: In my opinion many aspects of the global managment portion of the game have been improved. There is still a sense of urgency in getting things done, but no more &lt;insert nation here&gt; whining and leaving the global defense effort because you were a month late sending them a satellite. Many of the unit upgrades do cool things and give you interesting ways to position yourself and approach a battlefield. Largely the research and development cycle of the game hasn't changed, which is good because it was solid in XCOM enemy unknown. Plus points for 'squad upgrade' on buying certain basic weapons and armors. In enemy unkown this was a little more tedious with having to acquire said items per soldier using them.   The regular combat loop I believe has also improved over enemy unknown. The covert segments at the start of most missions allows you to map out the field and the locations of some enemies before you engage. More opportunites for set-up and field control. Also the pre-combat enemy teleportation that was present in enemy unknown is gone. Though this was hilarious in enemy unkown, it was also very annoying, I am sincerely glad this has been fixed. Enemies now actually patrol the map before first contact has been made. The addition of a scout class, which can remain in this stealth mode is also very welcome, especially for those who like to utilize long range snipers.   Negative 'Alien Hunter DLC': My gripe with this DLC, the cause of much rage and disappointment, is the addition of 'Ruler' units. This is an enemy unit with the capability of being your best friend over the course of several missions, and by best friend, I mean mop the floor with your guts. While the concept of having a recurring enemy or nemisis is interesting, I find the implementation here unappealing and very irritating. I believe what I mean will be clear, with a short description. While 'Ruler' units come in many shapes and sizes, they share the annoying trait of 'Ruler Reaction'. This allows them to make a FULL action for every HALF action one of the player units makes. For instance, if you move a unit, the 'Ruler' unit will then be able to move and attack, and it will do so immediately. This is the same for overwatch, hunker down, fire, or any other action made available to the player. So, for a standard squad of 4, if you really wanted to, you could give the 'Ruler' unit 8 moves on the your turn, and then it would still get to move on its own turn. I percieve this as an attempt at creativity, but it comes off as formula breaking and leaves a sour taste in the mouth.",

Some very strong points of this sequel are variable enemies, multiple resources, soldier classes and their skill trees, new buildable facilities and random generated levels. Graphics are also gorgeus, but mind that the game doesn't perform well all the time, which is the only minus in my book.  Strongly recommended for fans of turn based strategy.",

As your army gets stronger, so do the aliens. Expect to lose men, lose tools, and die die die.  STORY The story is fine, but not amazing. It's not to play this game, though it's there. Servicable.  DLC The DLC is really good (Shen's Gift and Alien Hunters). Shen's Gift as a new class, which is a burden on your supplies but a new balance of the other classes. Alien Hunters add new items and tough bosses. They both add a fun challenge to the geame.  MODS The real strengthen of this game is the mods.

Also, every play is different, and workshop content keeps it fresh and fun.

I sent the last soldier I had that turn to flank the last enemy on sight, but I sent her a lil´too far out, and she triggers a whole gang of freaky nasties that mindlessly trample and stab my whole squad. Half of MY men end up badly hurt, and the other half I now have to kill myself. I´m cursing, yelling and grunting at the stupid game, but after the rage tantrum I tilt my head down and whisper to myself: 'Well, THAT was a stupid move, dumbass'.

There are a few bugs, the difficulty seems to be far higher than the last game, I do wish Central, Tygan and all the rest would shut up on missions, I do hate it when the camera keeps being pulled away from you everytime a new enemy squad is sighted and I am not sold on the Avatar countdown but... it is still very good.  It is immersive, tactically very challenging and cleverly done.  I do wish that the difficulty did not ramp up quite as quickly as it does though because it seems like it forces you to follow certain research and upgrade priorities to the detriment of player choice - e.g. if you don't research plated armour pretty early on you are effectively stuffed. The upgrade to advent / alien forces month after month also seems relentless - I had just about got a handle on the Sectopods when they unleashed the Gatekeepers... the relentless pace of militarisation feels detrimental sometimes.  Then there are the soldier upgrades - in the XCOM reboot there were some skills which were pretty much mandatory to have effective characters... in this game it seems almost more so e.g. you might not realise it immediately but if you take blast padding over shredder it seems to reduce the effectiveness of your grenadiers enormously... the problem is that this is nowhere near as apparent as it was in the reboot and as it is an early choice you have to make, it is not until you start meeting the armoured enemies (often a couple of months down the line) that you realise what a problem it is.  It took me two failed playthroughs (that I had to abandon as I was hopelessly outmatched) before I settled on appropriate priorities for development of soldiers, research and construction priorities.  It is good but I think you need to be prepared to be hopelessly outmatched on your first playthrough.",
