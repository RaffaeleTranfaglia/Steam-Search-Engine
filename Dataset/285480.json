Errors:  -Game seems to blackscreen whenever you select something in the menus, but it only remains for 2-5 seconds. -Minor graphical bugs on ore deposits, fixed when player makes an action.  I will update this post the more bugs and errors I find. I know this isn't a review, but it is something nesscessary considering all the negative reviews. Please, reccommend this so others can see (if it works for you).",

The most I have been able to do is start the game and go through the menus. As for gameplay, havent been able to play yet, due to a constant graphical error that presents itself everytime you start a campaign or random map etc. Over all if you have 2 bucks to spend you might as well grab it. Maybe the devs who posted this will work on a fix or something to actually make it work, but I have my doubts.",
