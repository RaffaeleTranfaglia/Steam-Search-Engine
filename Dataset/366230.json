It features lots of well-designed characters, cool cut scenes, and over-the-top announcing. Still, it lacks online play and a way to save your progress as you make your way through season mnode. It's a really fun game with two players!",

            "review_text": "Classic 1980's style baseball. I thought it was corny when they first released on NES, definitely not for those who like the authenticity of MLB The Show or that of the 2K baseball series. We need another baseball game for PC, one that is worthy of being called an action sim. I can never purchase a stat crunching game, I like action, but autheentic action.",
