            "review_text": "This game required as ton of sacrifices. Pad is near essential, port is completely horrible and functionality of the PC version is near non-existent. If you don't want to risk, I can completely understand that. Avoid if you are not prepared or are not interested in rhythm games in particular.  That said, I just cannot force myself to give this game a negative review, since I had great time playing this. Yes, it's most difficult of the Bit.Trip original series, but the rhythm in this one is nearly hypnotizing. You need to be more precise with hitting those flying bit and pattern recognition is ESSENSIAL but I was constantly finding myself replaying those levels enjoying how much a great musical experience this game is. Your whole mind will act and react to the beat.  That said... Someone should contact the authorities. Making that poor port of such a great game should be considered a crime. This is like leaving a cute, poor puppy alone in the forest. It's sad and unfair.",

Its still a good game with good soundtrack and good rythim but i personaly didnt enjoy the mechanics used in this one like i enjoyed the ones in BIT TRIP BEAT. If you are looking to buy a bundle with all the colection then go for it. Its worth it. Otherwise dont buy this title anlone if you havent checked the other titler of the colection that are better in my opinion.",
