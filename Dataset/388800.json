If you're a fan of some of INTI Creates older platformers like Megaman Zero you may enjoy this one as well.  And if you were one of those quick to lambaste this the second it was released because of reasons that have been addressed by recent patches, do the rest of the community a favor and reconsider your reviews.",

            "review_text": "This game is quite amazing. By Inti Creates, the developers of the Mega Man Zero and ZX games (as well as 9 and 10), this is truly one great experience.   GAMEPLAY  It is very similar to the Mega Man Zero games in terms of mechanics, you can jump, shoot (in auto-fire), dash, wall-jump (you can't slide off walls nor wall-dash though), and something completely new, unleashing electricity (I don't know how it's called). Basically, it creates an electric field around you which hurts enemies around you, and if you shoot an enemy, which creates a lock-on, activating the field will hurt the enemy(ies) massively. There's an energy meter however so that you can't overuse it. It's an incredibely interesting concept, and I love it. It does create a bit of confusion in terms of how it works though, and it does variate the difficulty of the game a bit too much (sometimes it makes it too easy, sometimes too hard).   GRAPHICS  The 2D pixel art they used is amazing and is, once again, very similar to the Mega Man Zero/ZX games. The full-drawn art in cutscenes and dialogue is also incredible. Overall, it's great, no complaints.   AUDIO  Let's make this clear. The soundtrack is AMAZING. Ippo Yamada, the composer of many Mega Man games, including the future Mighty No. 9, returns to the stage and makes an impressive soundtrack. However, the instruments used in this are a bit irritating in certain situations, but considering how great the music itself is, I think it compensates. I think a re-mastered soundtrack for release would be a good idea, as long as it isn't overly changed. As for the sound effects, they're pretty basic. The voice acting in the English w/ Japanese Voice and Japanese voice settings is very good as well, but I can't judge too much because I don't know Japanese.   STORY  I'll have to give bonus points for the creators in this category. While the story itself is kinda the same as in MM games (bad guy does bad things), the way it is presented is remarkable. It's told in a mature manner, involving actual world problems and such in conversations and stuff. It's great.   LEVEL DESIGN  Not perfect, but still very good. The stages are fair, don't have many cheap deaths, and are overall very fun to play through. Only complaint is that they are a bit short, but that I'll address a little bit later.   DIFFICULTY AND LENGTH  This game is quite difficult, however very forgivable as it has no life system and you have a lot of health before you die. I like that very much. The length though is a bit disapointing. It's too short honestly. I was able to finish it my first time in 6 hours, which isn't that great. I find it kind of annoying that there are only 6 main bosses to choose from instead of 8 like in Mega Man games, which would have made the game longer. I also believe that the stages themselves are a bit short, the first try it takes only up to 10-15 minutes, but after that I can beat them in barely any time at all.   ONE FINAL COMPLAINT...  Now, even though I absolutely love this game, there is one thing, ONE thing that hurts it A LOT. The PC port. To put it simply, it's a mess. The screen is still split (as this was originally released for the 3DS), so it means that a lot of the area is wasted, it just doesn't look good. Thankfully, at least when you're in-stage, only one screen is shown and the HUD is properly placed. Worst of all, not only is there a launcher with this game (which is automatically a red flag), it's a pain to set up, I spent like 30 minutes setting up the thing to work perfectly. There are two sets for the English language, one with voice, one with not. But it doesn't matter because you can still turn the voices off in the voiced one, and it also has in-game conversations, but that again can be turned off so I'm not sure what the deal is. Just keep one set of languages, not two. It also means that you can't play in other languages with voice acting. Another annoyance is that the controller buttons have to be mapped in the launcher, but even then you can still switch controls inside the game, UGH, this is annoying. I heard that they fixed most of the issues since the release, and considering it was released only a few months ago, I'm expecting improvement over the PC port.   VERIDICT  This game is AMAZING. I LOVED IT. The PC port however hurts it quite a lot, and if you can, I highly suggest you buy the 3DS version instead. Haven't played it, but I can bet that it is certainly better than this. So, yeah, amazing game! Good job Inti Creates! Totally recommend you play this as soon as possible.",

To my knowledge this is their first Pc port of a game and the lunch was TERRIBLE, HOWEVER they listened to us, asked us questions and updated the game everyday until it was perfect. They even gave us extra content as an apology.  With the background out of the way lets begin with the game. Pros: -Music is really good, especially the J-pop songs.I listen to them everyday. -The control is almost as good as megaman zero games (also made by inti) which is really hard to do considering those games have some of the best controls in a 2d platformer. -The bosses are all really fun. -There are extra missions for those who like to spend more time. -The game has a level up system which helps those who can't beat it at first. -If you can get 1000 or more points your girl friends sings for you. -Extra speed run modes all change the experience and make the game that much better.  Cons; -Getting the best (true) ending is a pain. You pretty much have to play the final stage 2 times. -While the characters talking during stages is good the dialogue screen covers like 40 percent of the screen and reading usually cause a death. You can cancel it by pressing a certain button. -The final boss is pretty fun but the battle is pretty much lost when you get hit. Recovering is really hard.",

            "review_text": "I've played the 3DS version back in April and the controls were very tight.  Jumping to PC was a smooth breeze so far but that's mainly because I already have the key equipment required to fully enjoy this game.  My graphics card is NVIDIA GeForce GTX 550 Ti 1GB and so far it didn't mess up the framerate, it has been capped to 30 throughout, probably if it did get uncapped, there's a chance that the mechanics may differ significantly, similar to the PS2 era GTA games, Bionic Commando Rearmed 1 and Tomb Raider 2013 where certain sequence breaks were only possible at framerates over 150.   This game is getting some hate because it's not the most keyboard-friendly game, especially the lack of rebinding keys.  The Xbox 360 controller feels fine but I'm not a huge fan of keeping the Skill Attacks on F1-F4.  Personally I wouldn't mind an update that has an 'Advanced' tab, and let's say I clicked on F1 it should say 'press a button on *controller* to bind it'   Right now I would rather use JoytoKey addon and set:  Xbox's Y button to F1,  Xbox's BACK button to F2. Pushing the Left Stick (L3) for F3 and Pushing the Right Stick (R3) for F4  Mini-edit: For speed run mode, you're probably going to use F1 and probably F2 at the most and for practice purposes, you could set the Left Stick to F7 (save state) and Right Stick to F8 (load state).  I recommend this game BUT ONLY IF:  Keyboard users: There is an update where inputs can be rebind to a different key.  You have a controller with 12 buttons like 360/PS3 controller (4 face, 4 shoulders, a Start &amp; Select AND the 'L3/R3') You can accept this game runs at 30fps for the smooth anime-esque sprite work animation.  Another reminder, one of the layouts you can customise by holding the ALT button and move one of the screen's position or even change its size.",

Please, if you even have a little curiosity, I recommend you try this game, because it is an amazing sidescroller, and an amazing spiritual successor to the Mega Man Zero series.  /EDIT:  Okay. So. People have been obviously not been playing around with the game or -reading the freaking manual-.  You -can- change the size and position of the screen, and, in fact, even make the main screen full screen if you really want. Alt and clicking can move the screen and adjust the size, just as you would a normal manual.  Maybe it doesn't work on some graphics cards, but guess what, that's the life of a PC gamer. For me, on an -integrated card- of all things, it works like a charm, and runs like a dream.  It runs the exact same framerate it does on the 3DS, because -that's what it was designed for-. To say that it should be 60 FPS, is to go against the fact that the 3DS -can handle 60 FPS games-, but Inti still decided to make it 30 FPS on there.  There likely are bugs and little things that could be polished up... (like making it clearer how to exit the game so you can re-map things) But to utterly dismiss a port just because it doesn't change up the entire freaking game to your personal opinion, is simply and utterly stupid.",

            "review_text": "Played the game for about four hours and beat it, minus all the extra goodies it has to offer. Wanted to get through it so I could give my bit on what it was, if it was fun, so on and so forth. So know I've played it, and will be going back later to get the achievements (if possible).  So, Azure Striker Gunvolt. If you've seen snapshots and gameplay of this, it's Megaman ZX with a bit of a twist. Instead of just charging up your buster and firing off either little shots or big shots, it's a much more complex system of tagging enemies with your rounds, then electrifying them. I really don't feel like going into much detail as to how the game works, cause the dash works different, the movements different, there's weapons, upgrades, and gear (oh my!), but the core of this game feels like a Megaman ZX. Honestly, I like that about this game, cause I love the Megaman X series. Part if the reason why I bought it in the first place.  Down to the more sectioned off parts of the game, since I've already spoken of the overall gameplay, lets go to the graphics, sound, story, etc.  Visually, the game is not great, but not normal, either. It's got a flare to it that, again, feels like Megaman ZX. I say this because the game's villans are all transforming people with special powers, a lot like the Megamen in the ZX series. The very world itself feels similar, minus the desert stages that always seem to pop up. Now, while I was more focused on the game itself, the visuals were good. Like, 3.7 out of five good. There are only a few scenes where there's a full blown picture instead of just the sprites doing their thing, which is normal, and there's all sorts of neat places that are shown. Cities, jungles, underwater places. Take note, your character can, and will, drown. Fast. So, nothing to really exemplefy in the art/graphics department. What you see is what you get. If you are an in depth guy about this, I dunno. Message me. Maybe I'll get more in detail, but to me, visuals are a game's accompanyment. Sound was fun. It was an electronic feel, each stage had it's own little theme. I didn't pay much attention to it, either. If anything, I have the main menu's theme in my head. But the sound was just as decent as the visuals, where it wasn't amazing, but it was fun to have around. Normally, I never really listen to the music and just have podcasts and what have you in the background, but I'm glad I did mine this way. Also, the game's voices are (of course) in Japanese. No voice acting, though. Not really. Just little quips here and there. Lastly, the story. Now, I ran through this game extremely fast. I did was, again, focused on the gameplay itself. The characters were fun, and I liked them. For a game where there wasn't a ton of dialogue and everything seemed to be more put into the stage creation and the gameplay, I enjoyed the story to an extent. But it's a lackluster story about super powered people, a guy who finds a girl and goes lone wolf on his organization, but still works for them because he needs the money. After doing the rebel organization's dirty work, his waifu is kidnapped, and he goes to save her. Nothing new or original here, really. If anything, the ending is interesting (though I saw it from a mile away). What the story REALLY did for me was want to come back and play the sequel. I hope it's out, cause I want to play it and finish the game. So, while there was little character development and a lackluster story that's been reused more than fifteen times, I want to play the next game, which I guess is what really matters. I just wanted to see some more character development in general, with both Gunvolt and Joule (his waifu, basically. It's more of just a joke for me). I hope that when I go back to get the rest of the achievements, I'll be able to see some more of that, but I don't think I will. Honestly, this game visually, audibly, and story wise feels like a very well done Indie game. But nothing more, nothing less.   Now, the gameplay itself was fun. While I did fly through the game, I did feel like every stage was it's own place. Every stage had its own couple enemies specific to it, as well as the usual enemies that came along with every stage. The stages themselves had puzzles that didn't feel like it was a difficult task to complete, but a screw up would result in some serious punishment. 99.9% of the time, using your electricity will solve whatever puzzle you're having difficulty with. It's just how you use it that matters. Not only that, but the most interesting thing about it all is the risk and reward of using your ability. In most games, your abilities consquences are null. They don't either exist or matter. In Megaman, if you use your abilities, the most that happens is you deplete your ability gauge. So, there's management, but it's simple. In this game, while you do have to manage your ability gauge, that gauge is also what allows you to reduce damage, but only if you're not using it. It can help you float a bit, it helps with puzzles, etc. and so on. There are enemies that will come after you if you use you ability, and using it can get you hurt, but will damage the enemy as well. This risk/reward does no really exist as prominently in most other Megaman games, and it's what I find interesting about Azure Striker. Now, I understand it's not groundbreaking, but I admit they did it well, and I found it more complex than Megaman, which is just hold down the fire button, fire at enemy while dodging attacks, and repeat. With bosses, there's weaknesses, which don't exist in Azure Striker, just your skill with your ability and whatever gear you so happen to hold. If anything, the gameplay was fun and interesting, and is definitly worth a play through, if only because the game's on sale.  Regardless, I'm probably going to come back to this game and complete everything. Not necessarily replay, since I want to be done with this game, but it was still fun. Give it a shot.",

            "review_text": "Gameplay: Since this game made by Inti-Creates, the same company make MegaMan Zero, Megaman ZX and ZX Advent, I think the gameplay is simple to MegaMan Zero (Although the main character Gunvolt or code name 'GV' is simple to Zero for his hair). Only one thing different is Gunvolt can't learn any skills from defeating bosses but instead of that he learn by leveling up. The game locked at 30FPS but Inti-Creates not going to fix this promblem. Story: Kinda sadly at the Ending, but I think this kinda like MegaMan X4 (Except Gunvolt said: 'NOOO!!!' instead of 'What am I fighting for!!!?'). Story look interesting, but I recommend Inti-Creates should deal with the in-game dialogue cuz it kinda annoying and also blocking half of the screen while on a mission and keep messing thing. I think i don't even paying attention to the dialogue Controller: I don't know why the first version is kinda buggy, I think Inti-Creates rush making the game sprites actually use from the Nintendo 3DS, no HD Sprites for the PC ver. Controller kinda hard to controller since the first version I think Fire is J, Dash is Z, Jump is Space and Flashflied is L... not recommend at all. Feature: I like the feature like speedrun mode, hard mode, easy mode, and Perma-Anthem challenge speedrun and is NOT for Noobs. I think Inti-Creates should bring this to the 3DS Ver cuz it good for RPG Games. Voice: Good voice actor, Japanese voice always the best.
