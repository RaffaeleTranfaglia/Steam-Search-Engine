            "review_text": "Graffiti comes in all shapes, sizes, and variances in quality. For every breathtaking mural there's a dozen cheap tags ranging from the generic to profane. Similarly, Sideway: New York jumps violently between an abundantly stylish and creative platformer, to a cheap, controller hurling annoying one. Unfortunately, the imbalance often shifts toward the later, and even then the good parts only serve to highlight how frustrating the rest of the game is, which no amount of personality can save.  By now you've hopefully gathered that Sideway is based around graffiti, placing you running and jumping along cluttered walls, shifting from different panes and using parts of the environment to create a makeshift path toward the end. It's a really neat idea that's pulled off with a good deal of success, even when it's more often used for style than a core gameplay mechanic.  This is fine at first when everything is new and bursting with creativity, but Sideway falls on its face about halfway through by being at least twice as long as its content can sustain (which isn't saying much when it clocks in at just around 3 hours). Level designs start to repeat, backgrounds become less interesting as the originality wears off, and the 3-4 track soundtrack just keeps cycling through over and over (it will be going around in my head for days to come I'm sure). It also back loads most of its boss fights, which are easily among the most infuriating and poorly designed of any game I've played all year. Compared to the rest of the game, they create huge roadblocks that I wouldn't be surprised caused many players to simply give up on the game (which might honestly be for the best, as at that point the challenge is only going to keep rising).  Later levels also begin to focus heavily on combat, which is clunky, boring, and by far the worst element of the game. It's hugely perplexing why the developer chose to put so much effort into this one portion of the experience, but it's clear they spent a good deal of time on it and all that's come from it is a lesser game than we might otherwise have seen.  For the first hour or so I was really digging everything about Sideway. Its style is great, the premise original, and the entire package bursting with personality. But the further I got the more it seemed to try and put me off the entire game, spoiling the experience that came before and causing me to rather despise the game by the end. I hope the developer gets a chance to make another game and learns from the mistakes made here, but I won't be disappointed if we never end up seeing a Sideway 2.",

            "review_text": "I like the style of it, and it does some things sort of well, but they're almost all things that have been done before, and they're not done well enough to really be interesting. The mechanic of playing a 2D game on the sides of 3D buildings so you can wrap around and end up sideways in a previous section is kind of a neat idea, but it mostly ends up being problematic because it frequently makes it non-obvious how different sections are connected. The game also doesn't entirely feel smooth on what should be waaaay more than enough hardware to run it (i5 2500K@4.5GHz, 660 Ti, SSD, 1920x1200), even though FRAPS says it's sticking around 30fps with v-sync. It's not bad, but it's not that great either, which is kind of disappointing after they made Madballs in Babo Invasion, which was probably the only legitimate excuse to use the term 'amazeballs' (See, because it was amazing, and it was about balls...get it? I'll get my coat...).",

            "review_text": "Sideway™ New York is an excellent re-working of those classic 8 and 16 bit console platformer’s from days gone by, but with a far better graphics and a twist that smacks of a new genre in itself; okay 'new genre' may be stretching the truth a little, but the clever way the author has created a 3 dimensional 2D platformer is quite remarkable IMO.   The hero of the game, called Nox has to rescue his girlfriend. The action occurs on the sides of three-dimensional buildings. If Nox jumps off the edge of one wall, he ends up on the wall around the corner; this gives the levels a labyrinthine aspect. It takes some getting used to initially, but the transitions are as smooth as silk.   The game also has plenty of secrets, that become more elaborate as Nox’s abilities develop. Apart from the usual (run, jump etc) include the ability to create new platforms, spring boards, grappling hooks and grenades as well as being able to perform flying drop kicks ",
