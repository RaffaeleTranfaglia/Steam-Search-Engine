            "review_text": "Single player Hack and Slash (magic warrior) choice-based action game with time travel (or prescience), lots of humor, several good RPG elements, and a somewhat convoluted storyline.  Pros:  -Excellent combat system, easily the best I can remember seeing in a hack and slash/magic game. -Great enemy strength to get into the game. You'll probably die a few times, but not a slaughterfest. -Good progress of enemies getting tougher, more numerous, and more diverse and dangerous as you get Truths. -Excellent storyline, so many twists and turns! Unlike other choice based games, all of your choices actually matter. -Humor, it's a hurricane of puns, cultural references, fantasy references, sci fi references, etc. -Very fun to play, I played through it in a day, because I couldn't set it down for long. -Replayability is very high, there are many, many different endings, and even after you've gotten the true(best) one, you can still go back and find out what happens in all the others.  Cons:  -Length. It's not short by any means, especially with the replayability, but you only really have to play through 5 times (The first 4 to collect secret 'truths'). -Enemies just can't keep up with you, they more or less scale with your character's capabilities, but combine your burgeoning skill with it, and if you're like me, you'll end the game wishing there was an endless attack mode with enemies getting more and more aggressive/numerous just for giggles, training, and pure ridiculouslness of what you can get up to. -This is going to be a butt to play without a controller, aiming in precise directions (gl with arrow keys) is pretty necessary for precision. A joystick would probably work great though. -A couple of minor button failures where I would just stand in place pressing the same button and nothing happening. Pressing any other button would instantly unstick me though, and it might very well have been due to my controller/drivers instead of the game.  Verdict: It's a very good game. Get it, you won't be disappointed. It's not a super expensive game, and it delivers exactly what it promises in a very slick, polished and fun way. Oh and the combat system is epic. There's just no other way to put it. Play it for the combat system alone.",

            "review_text": "I don't usually review games but I felt driven to after experiencing this one.  The story pulled me in right away. I love the way the game progresses, learning from your mistakes after another, learning about the lore of the world and the characters around you, until you finally find the one path that'll get you your happy ending - which took me about five and a half hours to get to, still, many story branches (you can maybe think of them as timelines) left unplayed  The humor was refreshing, the narrator was really really good, and the overall world was just neat. I'd love to see a sequel/prequel or just another game that takes place in this world perhaps.  The bad: I have only mild complaints. I had a singular isolated incident in which my character got stuck and I had to return to the main menu and then continue back from the last checkpoint. I lost about 3 minutes of time perhaps. I wouldn't mind having some more enemy variety. Other than that, I'm suspicious that some steam achievements might not have popped that should have. (I looked through the achievements after completing the main ending and it seemed like I should've met some of the requirements for achievements I never got)   Ive seen other reviews say that the game is badly optimized and runs poorly or takes long to load. My experience wasn't bad at all. I ran it on the highest settings as well. I do have a pretty solid computer though, my specs inculde an SSD, an i7 and a GTX 770. No graphical issues at all. It does take a moment to load when going between scenes, but never longer than 5-10 seconds. I read a review that said they gave up on the game because the loading the game for the first time took too long. All I can say in response is that they're cheating themselves out of a very fun and fulfilling game.",

Gladly after finishing the game, you be able to travel back in time.. maybe you can save the universe, unlike i did. With every run you get new information, leading to new locations. A run takes ~1h.  There are over 20 endings you can discover. the story is really fun too. I like the voice actor tho. You should give it a try, if you like kinda games. ",

Pros: - Cool concept: The game's core idea of multiple choices is really well executed. You always want to see what your next run will unveil and this feeling never grow old until you complete the story. - Really cool aesthetics, with a very nice touch regarding the art style. - Cool narrative: this aspect never falls short as you unveil the various parts of the story. - Pretty good fights, well if you are not fed up with Arkham-style combats already.  Cons: - Still buggy: I ran into some issues where mobs where stuck up in the floor, forcing me to reload the game. - Bad optimization: Load times take ages, and the game suffers from frequent FPS drops, even on a higher-end configuration. - Low replayability: Going through all possible (bad) endings after you complete the story feels a bit hollow. This could be improved by adding more than one possible good ending to the game.",

I really liked the idea of the game, going through multiple stories, having to figure out how you can make it work. I haven't played something like this before but it was pretty nice.

Like Infamous?  THIS ISNT ONE OF THOSE. So if you expect alot of story variants, Go for it. It's totaly worth it.  Gameplay wise, it's a very simple, Almost disapointing at first glance, Hack'n'Slash game that use the mouse to move around and attack, But as you level up, you gain skills and you get a few variety of monsters that spices up the gameplay. It's not realy what will draw you into the game, but what will, is the Story and the main core mechanic of the game. I realy don't wana spoil it. So, I'll only reveal one of the things you'll discover after a few hours of gameplay probably:    There is 24 Endings.      But yeah. To be honest, after 2.5 hours, if you make the right choices, you start feeling like the game is going to be short. But at the same time, There's so much that you didnt explored, it makes you want to go back to the Previous choices and try evrything out. It feels realy good to know that something else might happens if you take a different choice, specialy if you're there for the story.  It's a realy good experience, It's peasing visualy too, Not too complicated either... Definitively recomend this game.",

I felt like I was listening to my grandfather read me a book back when I was a little kid, doing all the voices himself and sucking you further into the story.  The combat is another high mark of this game. It is so fluid, I didn't even really have to think to myself which button I needed to press, I just knew ahead of time what I needed to do, where I needed to be, and which weapon I needed to do it with. The art style is amazing, not much else I can say there.  This is one game I don't believe you will ever regret buying. I never will regret it. I will always treasure the time I spent on this game.

Granted, the game is not perfect, the combat could have more depth, your gear is maxed out relatively quickly while your level is not and the last chapter of every playthrough gets a little repetitive, but overall those are rather minor nitpicks in what is otherwise a very enjoyable indie title, well worth it's price.",

            "review_text": "Honestly I've put in quite a bit of time on the game and after going through 9 different stories I have to say this. The game has amazing replay value BUT skipping through beginning narrations that you've heard a million times before would be much appreciated as I have sat through that beginning too many times. Also, most of the time on this game is logged from long loading screens and narration you've heard before. Also, I was really disappointed that there weren't any boss fights, like I was looking forward to getting to take on the emperor or something instead of being told what happened. The enemies get really repetetive as well.  Spoilers***  After I completed the game I got both the lightened iblis stone that had absorbed the power of the core and the weapon. I dunno if I'm suppossed to have these or what but what I've come to honestly hate is the floating weapon that targets randomly and cancels my combo. It takes away from the gameplay for me and makes it less fun. Seriously there needs to be an option to remove that thing.  Another thing, the friggen optimization makes the framerate on my computer go bonkers. I literally had to take the quality down. This also impedes on fights and is super annoying.  Also, what's up with only being able to upgrade my swords twice? Did you guys just decide that you didn't feel like giving it a better look or ability? There's also the bottleneck effect with leveling. It was a pain just to reach level 24 and by the end of all the playthroughs I'll have reached like 30+, which is dumb considering you literally mow through the basic mobs. Also, the gems just stop at 3? The upgrade value for equipment was seriously skewed and I expected more.  Well those are all my complaints.  The game has a ton of replay value and the feel is pretty nice but after about 12 hours you're asking yourself why you are putting yourself through cut scenes that literally waste about 20 minutes of each playthrough. The music is nice and gives it a nice fantasy feel and the skills are interesting. Leveling after level 20 is a pain but you probably won't play for that long unless you're really bored. Still, I like the game and it kinda rubs off on ya. Is it worth it while its on sale? Yeah, sure. I mean, I bought it and I'm not too unhappy with my purchase.",

I got this game on the steam summer sale and put more than 10 hours into the game before the bugs and glitches just sucked the fun out of it for me.  I'll start with the pros that I can see with this game:  The Graphics are well done and look great even on my 4 year old lap top! The idea of 24 stories in one game WAS a great idea. Love the controller support made the game a lot more fun to play The point system for leveling is simple to understand for anyone Along with gems and your sword upgrades. Loved the idea of having to unlock doors to go into diffrent areas of the map. I like to explore and find things in games!  Sadly I will go onto my cons now:  You can't skip the opening part of the book. Every time you do a story you need to hear about the Isle's a ton of times and gets annyoying.   Also near the end alot of the stories seem to blend togetther and start to feel bland. I thought when I was going to play diffrent stories they would be a bit more diffrent.   The levels are pretty much the same if you pick to see the scientists in the nexus its always the same. It only changes if you go to the camp, which is always the same as well. Zenobia's island is ALWAYS the same along with the mountains, the amature, iblis stone and ect. Even when the doors dont have a point to me I'd go that way to do something diffrent. I thought the levels would randomize but they're borning and bland after a few play thoughts.  There is almost nothing to collect! With in a few play thoughts I upgraded all four of my swords and all of my gems making the side doors and chests in general usless! I was enjoying needing to explore but when I have everything whats the point?!  The combat is kinda awful, the main charater glitches out doing his dash move and gets hit by enemies. The shield gem makes shield ravens usless, I don't use it so I have to think about what I'm fighting. The ravens are supose to show ! point on there head so you can counter. Sometimes they don't in large fights and you take multipe hits that cancle your combos and reduce the XP you get from each fight making lvling difficult.  I also seem to randomly dash into bomb ravens even though Im not pointed that way. I've dashed into the ground and fell thought the map at multiple locations. I've tried to grapple into pylons and fell though the map at multiple times on diffrent levels in the game.   I've gotten stuck in the floor and had to restart the level multiple times and when I do open chests for health the fruit doesnt leave the chest, bugs out and stays in the chest so I cant even get it. I gave up and stop opening chests.   I've even died and the game gliched moved the foxes dead body back to the check point and wouldn't say 'You are dead' and bugged the whole level to the point I reset the game and the game thought I finshed the Level!  Sometimes platforms and the ground will glitch out so you run on nothing. It happens in the Iblis level, the nexus and on the final level as well. It's annyoying and confusing if your playing the level for the first time.  At that point I had enough of the this game. SO close to the end, so close to 100% completion of the book and I had enough of the glitches and bugs. This game had so much potentional and was such a cool idea but it feels like it's in BETA at best and is lacking so much. I wish the makers would go back and work on this game more before doing anything else.   Other wise don't waste your money or wait until this game is really really cheep.  So sad :(",

Don't take my time played and dismiss why I'm leaving a negative review, the gameplay and easiness was all fine, but a lot of problems exist.  Pros +  + Multiple paths +Very nice visuals + Movement looks nice + Dialog has funny and quirky moments + Enjoyable progression system + Relaxing, easy game + Hack n' slashing is always fun + Apparent 60 FPS + Controller controls are fine  Cons - And there are a LOT  First this game does not run well at all. The game by default reccomended all minimum settings on my computer with these specs:  Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4690K CPU @ 3.50GHz NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 Microsoft Windows 10 (build 10586), 64-bit 8 GB RAM  Cranking the game up to its fullest settings didn't slow it down at all, but the graphics were horridly buggy, especially shadows.  LOOK AND FEEL ISSUES (Graphics and controls)  - Visual shortcuts everywhere - Lots of clipping textures - Pop-in Textures are very distracting and un-immersive - Shadows took several restarts before loading correctly (Mostly character shadows, enviornment shadows were fine) - Load times range from instant to several minutes, and are VERY frequent. - Several issues occured with controls - Keyboard/Mouse is non-rebindable and native controls are awful (Left MB, Right MB, Shift, Ctrl, Alt) Don't you love when games have you float all around that Windows key. - Frequently lost control of character on keyboard/mouse (character would begin moving on its own until the game was paused and unpaused) - Several Xbox One controllers had movement lock issues, until the control was removed and reinserted. This occured about every 3 minutes, rending the game unplayable for me with the controller..  GAMEPLAY ISSUES  - Boring gameplay - Grappling is pointless, and only serves as forced movement sections - Puzzles all trivial, which isn't technically a con, but at a certain point it goes from easy to unintresting - Dash mechanic is flashy but useless - Sword 'toggles' are relatively pointless. - Enemy variety is awful - No Bosses (again, not necessarily a con, but it does work toward a bigger issue the game has, which is it gets boring quickly due to no difficulty or variety. - Few mechanics - No backtracking, game promotes collecting, but then punishes the player for making any wrong turns, by blocking the way back very very frequently (Every 60-120 seconds) - Checking destructables for loot is time consuming, rarely fruitful, and boring  STORY ISSUES  This is where this game lost me VERY quickly  - Story is very rushed - 'The ship crashed and your now here' used over and over and over and over. - Characters have 0 development, I would easily argue some characters have NEGATIVE development. (This means characters go from having some interesting lore and are just turned in to meat sacks or love objects) - Dialog is very hit and miss, but mostly miss. - Story is pictured through comic book style panes between levels, but these panes are very boring and are reused - I got a hour in to the game, and noticed a pane had been reused twice already. - This game does not understand repition in excess is always bad  I have never left a negative review, but this game was just not finished, and if this is what developers think is a finished game, then this is a joke.

But then the gods smiled and suddenly the game would load without crashing all of steam, something that I was never able to replicate again. The game plays alright when it works. Combat flows very well, even if the enemy encounters can feel a little samey at times. There are a few puzzles that are pretty fun as well. I wanted to like the writing, but I really could not. The narration is good, not Bastion level, but still good, but the jokes are awful. Most of them are just references to internet memes and pop culture, and only serve as a testament to why those don't work. More reccent ones, which reference Game of Thrones and Dark Souls, were ok, but I saw two references to 'What Does the Fox Say,' which just felt incredibly outdated. And the glitches. Framerate kept droppping for me, sometimes into the single digits on medium settings. That, and the fact that I couldn't get the game to open without crashing ever again, lead me to seek a refund for this. If the developers fix the game's issues, I could probably reccomend it for the combat, but in this state I can't do that.",

            "review_text": "This is a rather frustrating game. Here are my gripes:  - Not an RPG, a visual novel. Narrator is blaberring non-stop, there is no way to skip and instead of playing you are listening. For a visual novel - good - for an RPG - bad.  - There are scrolls in the world with a wall-o-text. So feeding you generous helpings of story aurally is not enough, you are also supposed to spend another 5 minutes reading a god damn scroll. Well at least you can skip *that*.  - The loading screens are black. I'm not kidding you. You do not know that it's an area end, and suddenly your screen turns black. Out of nowhere. Did my PC just hang? No, that's a loading screen. It just happens to be tastfully pitch-black, no embelishments, no boring tips, no nonsense!  - The game is 'optimized for controller' but it loses controller all the time. I mean I can move the mouse with steam controller, I can get to steam menu, by pressing the steam button while in game, so obviously controller itself works, and steam can talk to it, it's just the game itself suddenly stops reacting on controller button presses and stick movements. Not a kind of optimization I like.  - You cannot alt-tab from the game. The initial loading screen was taking too long and I made a mistake of alt-tabbing. That locked my machine well and good and I had to reboot. Switched to windowed mode for the next attempt to avoid that  - By the way, in the window mode they lock your cursor to the window, so although you are in windowed mode you cannot move your cursor out of the game window! Even if you want to click that little cross in top-right coner to shut it down. May be that's what they meant by 'controller optimized'?  - There are altars and 'crafting stations' in the game. At altars you improve your skills when you gain a level and at 'crafting stations' you improve your weapon when you collected enough 'ore'. This makes sense. What does not, is that as you move forward, the areas behind you get closed off by something looking like an energy field. God knows why. Probably because developers did not want to deal with the possible bugs causing by player back tracking, so they just desided to close it off for a heck of it. This feels unrealistic, but on the top of it it's also annoying. Say you are one ore short to upgrade your weapon, while next to a 'Crafting station'. You go around the corner and find the missing ore. Now you want to go back to the crafting station, but no you can't it's now closed off. Wait for the next one.  - Finally, there are check points right before a battle. If you happen to be low health on the checkpoint, you are screwed. You get your ♥♥♥ handed to you, but your only save is to right before the battle with your miniscule health. You can't win and you can't do anything, because you cannot go back and heal. So game over, start from the beginning.  I think I'm done.  ***Update***: so I finished the game today, took me 9 hours in total. This is how it went. - Playthrough 1 - Discoveted 1st truth - Playthrough 2 - Discovered 2nd truth - Playерough 3 - Discovered 3rd truth - Playthrough 4 - Unloced key plate icon that guides you to the final truth - Playthrough 5 - Discovered 4th, final truth - Playthrough 6 - Finished the game, a golden key icon indicated the correct story choice  Some of the gripes above lessened as I played the game but some are not.  The most annoying is still that you cannot go back and you do not alway know when you are goint to be blocked off. For an OCD person wanting to explore every possible path, this is supper annoying.  What turned out to be a lesser problem is health. If you end up a fight with amount of health less than a half of a total health you are topped up to half of you health for free. Did not realize it was the case when wrote the above.  *Some* narrative are skippable. But it does not help a lot because most are not.  Black loading screens you get used to after a while. They are not long anyway.  Controller disconnection plagues this game (working fine with other game so this is not a controller problem it's a game problem).   It's not possible to view your stats, or weapon stats, or skill descriptions, or weapon abilities if you are not at altar and/or crafting station. Was that really that difficult to add a button that shows them when you want to look at them?  If you have a program such as instant messanger that pop ups messaged on top of a full screen game, that locks the game. Quit everything that can do that before you play.  And window mode for some reason only activate after the game is loaded, that is the game always start at full screen and then if you chosen windows mode resizes itself in a window. I find this pretty lame.  There are very few enimy types: - normal melee - sheild - fire mage - support mage  That's it. You also have eyes but they are trivial, and they never participate in battles with other enimy types, you simply pick them up one by one from behind or from the sides.  This game done right might have a lot of potential, unfortunately I cannot recommend it the way it turned out.",

            "review_text": "Stories is a very, very flawed game.  It's built on a pretty interesting concept - experiencing all the different paths through the story, and all the different ways to fail. As you fail and restart, you carry over your items and experience gained, becoming more powerful as you gradually find your way to the one path that leads to success. At its best, combat can feel pretty thrilling as you dash madly about from enemy to enemy, slowing time as you block their attacks and throwing them about with ease. The story is nothing special, but enjoyable enough - it uses the narration gimmick from Bastion, but it feels unique enough not to feel like it was thrown in there just to piggyback on Bastion's success. The narrator is quirky and amusing, and has plenty of throwaway lines for quiet moments to keep things entertaining. The level design is also pretty clever - it makes frequent use of teleporters and transports to take you from one section to another, with different parts of the level visible in the distance, giving you an excellent sense of scale with its expansive views of the world around you.  Unfortunately, within two playthroughs you can see pretty much everything the game has to offer: All the levels, all the enemies, and you'll probably have created all the weapons too. It takes at least five playthroughs to reach the true ending. That means three playthroughs of the same things over and over, with just a few new pieces of story and dialogue, and the occasional level-up, to keep things going.  Combine this with a lack of boss fights (the game's 'finale' is a painfully tedious series of wave after wave of enemies) and a faulty combat system, and by the end, the game feels like a bit of a chore. Combat feels fine at first, but in larger fights there seems to be a degree of input lag, resulting in missed attacks or failing to block enemies. Also, enemy attacks can be quite unpredictable - at times nothing attacks you for a good ten seconds or so, then suddenly three will attack you when you have no way to block more than one at a time.  Stories is a game full of potential, and the developers have tried to do a lot. But it's just a bit too lacking in content, in depth of combat, in any boss fights or things to keep it going through playthrough after playthrough. I did have a good time with it despite its flaws, and it's an interesting, ambitious game - so I give it a slightly hesitant recommendation. It has a lot of untapped potential. Here's hoping the developers use this as a stepping stone to making a truly incredible game.",

In this game, your decisions completely change the flow of the story, and the events leading up to the ending are almost entirely different depending on every decision you make.  Some endings you feel sad, some you feel betrayed, and some are downright terrifying.  Despite being a tiny bit buggy, this game is a real masterpiece (considering its price tag at least. It's a bit short, but definitely worth it for the price.)  I would still give the game a 9/10 or maybe even a 10/10 despite its flaws. Buy it. It's good.",

            "review_text": "The Metacritic for this game is 75/100 and I'd completely agree with that rating because I'd give it around the same score myself.  Stories: The Path of Destinies is a Narrative Story Hack N Slash that's about creating your own destiny and by completing certain paths you unlock destiny cards or basically different cards with different outcomes.  Now though this game allows you to create your own story, there is a destined story that you'll want to hit in order to unlock the true ending of the game. Without spoiling the game I'd recommend not going down the same patht oo many times if you want to complete the main story in an optimal time.  Pros: - Talent Tree - allows you to upgrade your guy progressively as you level up your character (the more you play the higher you level), you can increase damage, health, etc.. with this tree. - Gem/Sword system - each sword you unlock (with a max of two levels for each sword) gives you a special ability that you trigger with the shift button. These swords are also keys which allow you to access different portions of the map that gives you access to gems. Gems are another way for increasing your damange and sustainability within the game. Though you don't necessarily need gems to complete the game, they make you feel extremely awesome. - The Narrator may have been the whole story with it's witty remarks and references to other games. They did an amazing job with the narration of the game.  Cons: - Not a true ARPG, it's a Hack N Slash with passive abilities to make your character strong, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but once you've maxed out of sword upgrades you just get health and energy from normal chests. - There's essentially sound 3 maps, I haven't completed every destiny ending, so there could be more portions to each map, but if you aren't used to replaying maps like in say a diablo you might not like this game because you're basically replaying the same maps and trying to get a different story/create a new destiny basically. - Menu could get some QoL work. When you open the crafting menu and press escape instead of it closing the upgrade crafting menu it opens the settings menu which is annoying when you want to exit very fast from the upgrade crafting table. - The grab mechanic sucks, it's very hard to grab when you have your hook ability. - Oh when you hit a narration portion you've already heard, you can't skip through the dialog with space. Some things you can, but a lot of it you can't which can be very frustrating for some people especially if you die.  Overall the game is great, the main story was fun to figure out and despite the repetitiveness of the combat it did make you feel awesome as you faught enemies. I'd give this game an easy 7-7.5/10.",

            "review_text": "Stories is a fun, if basic, action-RPG that hangs the bare bones of an enjoyable, but slender, gameplay experience on a truly intriguing story system (hence the name). You play as the fox action hero Reynardo as he battles ravens with the (in-cutscene-only) rabbit bandit Lapino and cat sorcerer Zenobia. The cel-shaded, heavy-bloom art style has a lot of charm to it.  Gameplay is your basic timed-strategy mash-X-to-sword action game, novel seven years ago in Arkham Asylum but done to death since then. While this one doesn't reinvent the wheel in that respect, it uses its basic building blocks well. Beating the crap out of ravens does get old by the time the credits roll, but some new skills and perks that regularly pop up are fun.  The game would be simple fun, but tiresome, if it weren't for the story system. You can complete a storyline in an hour at most, but the hook is that there are 24 stories. Each one differs depending on the branches you decide to take at different points, and you need to keep going through more branches to unlock the full story and help Reynardo win the war of the ravens and toads. You need to play through five stories in total, minimum, to beat the game. If not for the overarching plotline I almost wanted to give up before the finish line, but occasionally the swordplay sings (especially when you're racking up 100+ combos) and the story plays out strong enough to keep you invested to the credits. Most people will want to look up which storylines get you through quickest - you need to find four 'truths' in-game, each one of which is accessed from six endings. But it's easy to make mistakes depending on your choices. If you get stuck doing two or three plotlines that unlock the same story piece, you'll lose interest well before the climax, and only completionists will play the 25 hours or so necessary to do so.  Those who churn through games like butter may not be enthused about this one. It's a 7/10 competent brawler raised up by top-notch story innovations. But there's enough fun in there to warrant a recommendation, especially if/when it's on sale.",

            "review_text": "Probably the most interesting game I've played, with the most enjoyable way to experience a story. It's some sort of choose your own adventure, but with only one real ending in which you win. The only way to succeed is trial and error, experimenting with different choices, and learning 'True things' to help you find out the best path. After that it's a cake walk to an ending I haven't seen yet. (If you care to know why, read the stuff below, otherwise just skip to the last bit where I mention combat.)  ---  The only problem is that even with the lowest settings, my computer seems to turn into a toaster. It's usually not to bad. if I just spam the attack button and hold down the healing swords ability, I can tank any fight, and continue onwards to another ending.   Sometimes, I even get a wonderful moment, where there is no background to load! Just me, the enemies, and a smooth running game. When that happens, it's probably the most enjoyable game I could play! I really enjoy fighting, especially when it's as smooth as those blue-moon moments. But usually it's not like that.  I've played this for a bit now, and gotten past some laggy moments, long load screens (Probably due to toaster electronics) and made it to the TRUE ENDING! which I shall not spoil, that would be rude. That, and I can't get past the last fight scene. It's too laggy, and the enemy horde too big to tank through like every other lag fight.  Sometimes, the land won't even load in, and I'm 'Floating' in mid air as I stand on invisible ground.  It's worth it if you don't use potatoes to run pretty games. I'll have to live with the cliff-hanger I've ended up with, but if you have anything better than what I have, and you want this game, go for it. You probably won't regret it. ---  Oh and on a side note, others say the combats a bit repetitive, but IMO it's alright by me. I could see the repetitive argument and why some would say it, but I enjoy the way it goes.   On an XBOX controller, you press X to attack, A to Dash (If unlocked) and Y to hook things (It's a mandatory unlock, but it's not there at start.) You get 4 swords and their abilities that you can use with Right Trigger. You can cycle weapons with the Dpad. Combat is usually pressing X between multiple enemies to beat them to a pulp via a chain of attacks, or to preform a counter attack if an enemy attempts to attack you. You can use abilities in combat, but I'll let you find them out yourself.  You can also get 3 Gems in your glove (There are more than 3, and you can swap what you have at a bench.) which do minor things to affect your game such as attack speed, and damage resist etc.  Thats it, really. I've probably missed something. Anyway It's a pretty fun game, try it out.  EDIT: I almost forgot! BUGS! I don't think this is due to my lag, it seems more like bugs, but Dashes don't always work to the full length of a dash. I seem to get caught on small bumps in the terrain, and can't dash up/down ramps at all. It's caused a few many deaths when Dashes don't work  Dashes also get me through the invisible walls that line the maps playable areas, and I can get stuck in those said walls, or stuck behind them. I bet I could use this to speed-run this game somehow, but it just gets me stuck.  Dashes and attacking props on the map can also make me sink into or even THROUGH the floor itself.  I've also gotten stuck on-top of an enemy, somehow. It happens mid-combat in the more laggy areas, so this might actually be lag. Enemies also get stuck on me, or hang mid-air sometimes aswell.  And to top it all off, Chest's loot doesn't always launch out properly, and can get stuck in the box! I'd like my apples and blue tomatoes please! Atleast gems and sword ore/essence pops out properly!",
