            "review_text": "Pros +solid gameplay +passable sound effects +good level design, and distinguishable terrain. You won't get confused as to what's what. Very useful for this type of game +Ability to plan out the execution of an entire mission, and watch your men methodically carry it out in seconds. +Ai works well at following said plan  +Customization: Lots of gear to choose from and unlock. +Level designer/randomizer: Unlimited replayability   Cons - A little bit pricey for my taste. I prefer $10-15 at most for an indie game of this quality - Still a few bugs to iron out - Can get hard to plan moves for your last member on your team, as the order lines stack up    Techical issues -Can't seem to plan my men to swap their weapons twice during the planning phase. I can tell my men at a certain point to pull out their secondaries, but I'm unable to tell them to swap back. I have to wait till they actually change weapons to order them swap back at a later time. Can be annoying when trying to unlock achievements for each level.  -Unable to hide other units command lines during planning phase. When you have commands issued for a large amount of soldiers, it looks like pasta all over the place. Can make it very hard to issue orders to the last soldier on your squad.   -Sometimes I want to order a certain swat member to throw a flash bang through a door, but a nearby teamate stacked on the door recieves the order instead. The game needs a toggle function for ordering stacked teamates to do something instead of the default choice.   -When cancelling a command, it sometimes does not dissapear, making you have to backtrack your soldiers moves a good bit to fix it, or restart them completely.  Rating: 8.5/10 =========== Gameplay: 9/10 Graphics: 7/10 Sound effects: 7/10 Ai: 9/10 Replayability: 10/10    ",

            "review_text": "I'll admit, I haven't gotten very far, but the bit of it I did play was exceptionally good for what its supposed to be. The controls do seem to be a bit difficult to master, but at least for the simple mechanics, you do catch on quickly.  The action is quite tactical, no nonsense. I definitely get the feeling that there is an incredible amount of depth in the game, and already I'm looking forward to playing again.  The built in mod-ability and mission generation, combined with the fact that the game is built around its solid mechanics (rather than any sort of linear narrative) seems to ensure that the 'dollars spent':'hours of fun' ratio is quite favorable.",

            "review_text": "One of the best games i've played in a long time, will be perfect for those nostalgic about the old SWAT games. While being highly addictive, its mechanics are extremely simple and easy to understand. Yet there lies a great challenge in executing them flawlessly, and succeding with your objectives without losing any of your men. Lots of content in it in form of single missions, campaigns, mod support and mission generator, so there's essentially an endless amounts of mission to go on. There's also some basic customization to get you a bit emotionally attached to your men (and women). However it seems that there are no female voices, so females will report in with male voices.  No mp or coop yet, but I think they are planning to add that after phone versions release.  Sidenote: If you use steam overlay a lot keep in mind that the shift key locks the path, so after you've been to the overlay press shift once to make the controls normal again.",

            "review_text": " Solid tactical gameplay with a great feel to it.   The gameplay is divided into two parts, the planning phase and execution phase. The planning allows you to set up waypoints and stops using radio commands. Once in the execution phase you can watch your plan unfold or at any moment take direct control of your men. Add to that troop customization, gadgets, classes and squad perks, and you've got an enjoyable experience at hand.  To me the game comes across as polished and well made. I enjoy the graphical style and the sound and atmosphere is good. The big challenge lies in creating a plan that'll allow you to sit back and just watch the execution phase. Difficult, but very satisfying when it works.",

            "review_text": "You may or may not be a fan of the movie The A-Team, but you probably know the famous catchphrase from the movie:   I love it when a plan comes together.  Door Kickers is a game that can give you this feeling. Door Kickers is a difficult but rewarding game with lots of tactics. You are the leader of the SWAT team. You can choose which equipment they will use on a mission and which insertion point is best for the them. You make the plan for the team and hit the play button to see them execute it resulting in a failure or success. You can also pause the game in the middle to change the plan. You can control each SWAT team member on field in real time too!   Pros     Lots of tactics ( One of the best tactics game I played. Reminds me of old SWAT games.)   Random placement of enemies everytime   Lots of missions to play and you can create your own too    Variety of classes each having their strength and weaknesses   Skill tree and lots of equipment you can buy and use (For example Tazer, Hammer and many more)   Compaign and Mission replaybility for medals    Cons     Real time controls are not that good   If you like planning and strategy then I definitely recommend this game. 9/10",

            "review_text": "If you like games such as SWAT 4 and the Rainbow Six games of old, then you will most likely enjoy this.  There are a few different modes of play. Single missions (there are a lot!) allow you to essentially practice. The first few limit you to using only 2 good fellows against a small number of enemies with a mix of objectives. The objectives I have encountered so far are include (and you may have multiples of these on a mission) killing all the enemies, saving hostages, retrieving evidence, arresting a high profile suspect and escorting a VIP. There is also a random mission generator where you get to pick how big the map is and how strong the resistance is. Also you can create your own maps or download new ones from the Steam Workshop.  The campaign mode can be unlocked after levelling up your squad by completing single missions. In this mode, if your troopers get injured they will be out of action for the next mission to recover, if they die they are dead. Dead as a dodo. Luckily you can restart the mission (don't leave the mission though!). However, there is also a hardcore mode, which will prevent you from doing this.  Completing missions gives your squad experience (divvied up between the used members depending on how well they performed). As your squad levels up, you unlock more classes and also skill points to spend on improving the overall squad's reactions times and accuracy and a few other benefits. It also scores you out of 3 stars depending on how well you got your squad to perform. To get maximum score you need to and keep all your squaddies alive and complete all the objectives within the time limit. Those stars you can then spend on unlocking new weapons and equipment.  Speaking of which. any tactical shooter would not be complete without giving you the option to swap out your gear. Each man has a slot for a primary and secondary weapon, armour, 2 small equipments such as flashbangs, breaching charges or lockpicks and 1 large equipment such as a camera to poke under doors or a massive hammer to smash down locked doors. There is quite a nice variety of weapons and equipment but I have found that there are only a couple of weapons I use anyway. There is one caveat: different classes allow and/or limit the equipment each guy can have.  There are currently 5 classes playable: Pointman, Assault, Breacher, Stealth and Shield. The Pointman, as far as I can tell, is meant for high speed and mobility encounters (as I found with the VIP missions – if you don't get to him fast enough they shoot him!). You can only use a pistol but if used correctly, or if you have some meatier backup, then this isn't a problem. The Assault class gives you the option to equip some rifles or SMGs and is pretty self explanatory. The Shield class drops the primary weapon in favour for a ballistic shield. The level of protection the shield gives depends on which one you use but don't leave him on his own, he can only use a pistol. The Breacher uses shotguns which allows you to quickly blow locked doors off their hinges and is obviously handy in close quarters. Just don't send this guy into a small room with hostages in! The final class is Stealth. Essentially you get some suppressed weapons, which (not surprisingly) reduces the amount of noise you make.  So what is the gameplay like? Well at the beginning of the mission you get to pick who you want to bring along and then place them in the predefined starting locations. Then you can plan out your mission before hit the play button. Once started you can pause at any time and make adjustments where necessary. The UI is very easy to use and entering rooms is far easier than any of the FPS games. How many times have you been trying to prepare a flashbang, only to accidentally open the door and have an AK47 in your nose? That isn't going to happen here (unless you like surprises and to go in all guns blazing).  The AI can be lethal and you will want to make sure you keep those doors and corners covered just in case someone decides to take you on. Surprising the AI is always the best option but once they know you're there they will usually be ready for you in the next room or sometimes kill a hostage or start destroying evidence so you will have to be fast. If they are ready for you, you won't want your guys stacking up in front of the door waiting for the flashbang to go off. Those few seconds can get your entire squad killed, get them in cover or stacked either side of it! Or if there are no hostages in there, just use and breaching charge and blow them all to hell.  This is definitely worth picking up and if you see it on sale, you have no excuse. Great game.",
