The tutorial 'just ends' when you reach the first station?  Missions you accept seem to disappear completely (Active Jobs is more often than not empty after you return from a mission?)  I like games like this - take missions, mine, shoot, trade, improve ship - repeat - but this one feels unfinished?",
