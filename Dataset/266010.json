They lived in their palette world filled with multicells, quite contempt but lonely. One day they discovered they had identical partners who wanted to meet them. The three friends ran across to join them, but never against one another because of their trusted bonds of friendship. They decided to dance working together in unison via a melodic vec-flow pattern to illustrate their happiness. Unbeknownst to them, they were simply puppets to a 'Hacker' trying to solve the alphabetic password to access the  'LYNE’   files.",

            "review_text": "It's time to take a break from AAA titles and indulge in the serenity and minimalism of this game. The music score is soothing. The game concept is based on connecting the dots except that it also features color based strokes/ paths and a single stroke is needed to fill each color. The strokes cannot overlap or cross each other. You need to find a path to connect all the boxes of each of the color codes.  This is definitely a challenging puzzle otherwise it would have been dull and boring. It's hard but worry not because the pace and learning curve builds up smoothly as you easily navigate few levels in each 'set'. There are as many sets as there are alphabets in the English language. Get those letter achievements to flaunt your showcase. The game also includes Daily sets which are randomly generated but need to be completed for the particular day.  You gain skill points as you progress through the sets. The points can be used to unlock many theme colors to suit your comfort and style.  Nothing about this game is repetitive. Sometimes there is more than one solution to a puzzle. Now if you are in it only for collecting achievements, then here's a  guide  for you lazy peeps. No, I don't use the guide because I prefer to work my brain and not ruin the sanctity of this masterpiece. Besides, it's a wonderful way for me to escape from the mainstream games once in a while. I am not gonna hurry on this one even though I want achievements fast. Take a deep breath and relax.  Rated 10/10",

            "review_text": "LYNE is probably one of the best (if not the best) valued casual puzzle games on Steam. At $3, you are essentially paying for 650 (divided between 27 sets) preset puzzles plus 50-75 (divided between 2-3 sets) puzzles randomly generated daily. The game has a broad range of difficulty so it's accessible to all kinds of players. You can essentially cherrypick which puzzles to do because the game rotates between single to multicolor puzzles that add an extra layer of complexity to the puzzles.  Aesthetically-speaking, the minimalist design is a boon for this game. The lack of clutter helps one get in the mood for some puzzle-solving. There's also an assortment of color palettes made available simply by playing through entire sets and earning 'seeds'. Overall the game is quite easy on the eyes.  With that said, I think that $3 for this game is quite a steal. I used to do all sorts of different puzzles on the newspaper back when that was more of a thing. It's great to have something affordable that I can default to if I ever feel like solving puzzles out of the blue (even after finishing all the preset puzzles). I implore you to at least consider this game if you are a fan of any and all puzzles.",

Shapes are positioned in a manner that makes successful pathways between them all far from immediately obvious, especially once you realize paths cannot cross. Junction boxes add to the task, demanding you enter them a specific number of times to illuminate all their lights. Failure merely results in a sadly pulsating red outline and the realization you must rethink, experiment, and iterate.  At this point, Lyne could have become a frustrating mess, but smart design eliminates any notion of such a problem. Paths between shapes can be partially created and temporarily abandoned while you fashion the route for another. There’s no limit on time or attempts, and levels are unlocked in sizable sets, meaning you can always try an alternative if you find yourself stuck. Conversely, if you become a Lyne guru in short order, there are procedurally generated daily levels available once you’ve worked your way through the first two sets of 25 apiece.",

There's not a whole lot to say about this game other than it is very comparable to the phone game 'Flow', but with way more advanced mechanics than Flow.  But the thing is, such a simple puzzle game is just a cover up for an insane cryptography puzzle the developer put in the game as a bonus. Each time you beat a set you get 1-5 code piece to the puzzle. There are 999 pieces, which means you have to solve 200 - 999 sets. The puzzle has been decrypted, however. (solution on the community discussions)  My only complaint I had was the palette swaps you unlock as you get points. Most of them just ain't good because the colors blend with each other too much. I have not unlocked the last palatte swap but The only ones that are good are the Deep Space and Electro.  The achievements are cool too.

If you think the game is to easy... look for sets with more triangles under them, you wont say it's to easy for long xD  Unlike a few other games I don't love this one because it has pretty graphics, awesome textures, or a nice physics engine. I love it because it is exactly what any game that has those isn't. In all honesty, I'd rather have something that is both challenging and fun, and yeah a background color change doesn't hurt either, than have the newest high graphics, most detailed texrtures, and most complex physics engine out there.  Sometimes, when done right, 'Simple' can be one of the best games out there and you don't even know because you don't even give it a chance because it's 'Simple'.

The gameplay is simple, you just over the 2D-shape into the same shape one through  n -hole(s) octagon.  n -hole(s) octagon connects one shape to another same shape. There are three kind of shapes: triangle, square, and rhombus. Each of them will appear into different combination.   By the way, you can change the color of pallet.  How about the puzzle? Some puzzle are easy to solve, but others are ♥♥♥♥ing hard to solve.   Actually, I know the key to solve puzzle. See the  pattern ! What? Yes, see the pattern!  The key is pattern of connector ( n -hole(s) octagon).  If it's a 1-hole octagon, what do you should do? If it's a 2-holes octagon, what you should do next? If it's a 3-holes octagon, what you should do? If it's a 4-holes octagon, what you should do next?  Did you see the pattern already? Is it Maths? Yeah... I hope you can read it.

Don't worry if you don't know what I'm talking about; the game has a gentle learning curve. The puzzles are short (you'll solve some in 5 seconds, and probably stare at others for 5 minutes), but there are 650 of them predefined, and the game procedurally generates more on a daily basis. It's generally a fun, relaxing game, but can grow challenging and even frustrating at times (in a good way). Graphics are just lines and soft, solid colors, which works well here, as do the equally soft and minimal musical sound effects. Given the reasonably low price I highly recommend picking this one up. You'll have fun while learning something about graph theory (though you may not be aware of the latter).",

Not to ruin the experience, but you won't notice the change in pace. You'll grow with the game and find your skill improving as the game evolves through mechanics.  With that said, it boasts a set of 25 levels for each letter of the alphabet and rewards you with new skins to play the game in... and it's enough.

No, LYNE does something much better and allows you the freedom to explore the puzzles, learn the bits and pieces and relax all at the same time. If you like puzzle games, this is fantastic.

The game doesn't hold your hand; it doesn't punish you for taking your time, making a mistake, or starting over as much as you need to; and it isn't a huge timesink where you feel like you have to sit there for however long and can't walk away. The levels are grouped into manageable sets of 25, and you can easily do two or three sets in less than half an hour — but you don't have to. You can do as few or many levels at a time as you want. You might lose yourself in the game…but you won't feel trapped if you don't  want  to be trapped.  The learning curve is neither too steep nor too flat. Having done set A and B and today's two Daily sets, I never felt like I was in way over my head, but I never felt like I wasn't being challenged at all. I wasn't being challenged  intensely , it just feels like a sustained, low-grade hum, which is sometimes exactly what the doctor ordered. The flute-like notes that play with each connection are a great addition to the atmosphere, and the light crescendo when you finish a puzzle is surprisingly satisfying.  Playing LYNE is like going for a leisurely walk in a nice neighbourhood or nature trail. It's not intense exercise, but you're burning calories and releasing endorphins all the same, you choose your pace — and the scenery is lovely.  P.S. I also commend the 'Daily' sets. Each day you get two sets of procedurally-generated levels, which vary in difficulty according to the day. So in addition to the levels that are already in the game, you get what is effectively an endless supply of additional levels. It's like buying a sudoku book and then also getting a free sudoku delivered to your doorstep every day for the rest of your life.",

I had bought alot of games, and only bought this on a whim, thinking to myself 'Can't hurt, if it's crap, I got a lot more games to play'.   And boy am I regrettful for my attitude prior to playing this game.  The game works for both casual players just looking to kill some time before going out, and those serious players who want to solve every last puzzle their brain power can possibly muster.  It's a simple idea that gets really challenging (and I mean REALLY challenging). Your goal is to connect the dots. Easy as that may sound, more dot's come along and you start getting confused, wondering whether this line goes here, or there. It feels so rewarding to solve a level you had been working on for a half hour.  The sound effects are easy-going, making it easy (and ideal) to listen to your own personal soundtrack.  Lyne is game that is incredibly addicting (steam didn't get my hours logged in right) and stands among one of the best games I've bought this holiday. And I bought it for just a dollar.",

            "review_text": "LYNE is something I haven't found in a while; a simple puzzle game with a casual element to it. I've always loved casual puzzle games but I've never been able to find many, especially in recent times. I love the concept for being such a simple yet malleable one. All you do is connect lines. That's it, but, adding more simple ideas, such as different colors and looping lines through themselves, gives this game a great variety and suprising difficulty.  And it's not short either. There's 26 sets with 25 puzzles for each one and a steady increase in difficulty, introducing harder mechanics throughout every 1 or 2 sets. But what happens when you get through all of those? Where do I go now? Well, there's a wonderful daily system in place that randomly generates 1-3 sets, each with a varying degree of difficulty. Each day, you can come back and play a new daily set of sets, giving this simple game a huge replayability.  However, there are some minor, minor problems. One of which is the difficulty spikes. One puzzle in a set usually has me there for at least 5 minutes whereas the rest of them are around a minute or less. Now that's too bad, as getting stuck helps me get better at thinking in different ways; looking at things in a different perspective. Although, it is slightly annoying to be stuck on a puzzle for so long. Also, some people may complain about the 'lack of tutorial' when introducing new things, but that's what makes this game unique and stylized. That's what makes it so rewarding to solve a puzzle that you've been on for 5 minutes or longer.  But the best thing by far in the game is the atmosphere. The sounds and the ability to change palette really sold me on this game. I thoroughly enjoy just clicking on the shapes and listening to the sounds ping off, and then connecting makes shapes gives me a little reward. When you complete a puzzle, a simple ambient sound resonates through into the next level and the screen goes white, knowing that I solved the puzzle and that this is my reward. When I don't complete a puzzle, it tells me what things I need to connect and flashes at me in red to help me guide my way into solving the puzzle.  All in all, this game is great at what it does and took a very simple concept and expanded it greatly. With it's wonderful sound and level design, it did great to suck me and it seems like a game I would play for years. Basically, purchase it now. It's cheap enough to not pick up. Buy it now!",

It's an eventually infuriating but ultimately satisfying experience to be able to complete.  The music, as stated, is also intentially calming. The background pads drone as each connection is audibly accentuated with a soft syntheized pop. It's minimal, but that's the point, and it's destressing enough to make up for those moments where you can't seem to make the right connection.

The concept is rather simple: Create lines between like shapes, and don't intersect others. It's a bit more complicated than that later on, but that's the jist of it. The lack of a soundtrack, only accompanied by chimes and soft sounds, is beautiful. The basic color scheme, and calm graphical design, create an immediately calming presense. The level design is something else. While some are incredibly easy, others will almost certainly impede your progress, but without leaving the bitter taste of a poor puzzle. I found that each harder puzzle was only one or two mouse clicks away from being correct, and completing such a puzzle leaves a pleasant aftertaste. Not to mention the seductive chime that plays after every completed level.  I haven't played terribly far into the game, but I've realized just how clever, how beautiful it really is. I tend to find solace in video games after a long day, and lately, my only interest has been to complete more puzzles here!

I will point out that there is also a mobile version of Lyne, and I actually might recommend that one instead. The Steam version works perfectly fine, but it's designed more with 5 minute chunks of playtime in mind. But on either platform, there's really nothing to dislike here.  The Steam version has one huge advantage and that's having some of the best looking achievements around. If you 100% the game, you get a full alphabet of achievements that you can use to write things in the achievement showcases on your profile. It's no simple task to get them all, but it does give you something fun to use after you are done. I discovered the game because I was looking at someone's profile and their achievement showcase read L A S A G N A, and I knew I had to have those achievements.

Each colored block can only be visited in the path of that color, neutral blocks have to be visited a certain number of times, and paths can only cross at those neutral blocks. That's it. Pretty simple.  Most levels are extremely easy (5 seconds), but many take a bit longer, and a few are pretty hard, in which case you're trying things for 10 minutes. There are 26 sets (A-Z) of 25 levels each, and up to 3 randomly generated sets every day, varying in difficulty. Solving sets unlocks themes and gets you closer to the magical '999 points' that the menu encourages you to reach. Because of the sheer volume it's a good time killer.",

Yes, it's a game where you connect shapes with single lines, but it goes so astronomically far beyond that. I can't even properly explain how the problem solving ends up working on each level; it's that fluid and intuitive. You just... start with one color and then try other colors until it works, and there's process of elimination and trial and error and each level completed is a soothing, peaceful little tidbit of satisfaction. The very early levels provide a good example of this game's whole vibe, with gameplay hints disguised in three or four words that you have to look at in relation to the current level and what you need to do. That's hard to explain too, I'm not doing it well. Lyne is calming and focusing at the same time, and I would have gladly paid full price for it. Heck, I would've happily paid like ten bucks for it if it was that price and I had a chance to try it out first. Do yourself a favor, even if you're not a huge fan of puzzle games, and buy this game. Also buy copies for everyone you know, if it's on sale. 11/10 excellent flawless game.",

There are times when you might find surprising yourself. (Those are the moments when it seems like your eyes and hands coordinate without you knowing and the puzzle gets solved instantly. I don't know why or how, but it usually happens when my thoughts are lost on other things. LOL.)  I, generally, recommend this game to those who love and are into puzzle games.

No soundtrack (there is audio as you interact with the pieces and finish stages), but this lets you put on any kind of ambient music that you want. This would be a con, but I don't think it's reasonable to expect this game to have a 10+ hour soundtrack.  ? It's a puzzle game, so if you don't like puzzle games, don't buy it. ? Casual  Edit: After beating the game (all the puzzles and some of the random daily ones) I can't say this game was mind-bendingly difficult, but I did get stuck on a few levels from time to time.
