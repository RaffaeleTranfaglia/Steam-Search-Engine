            "review_text": "I bought this game on sale. I actually played it through which took me around 22 hours. However I think Steam only logged me 2 hours of playtime. (I mostly play offline.) I chose this game because I liked the “art style” and to be honest the premise of romance in the whole story. Since I’ve seen quite a bit of trashy RPG Maker games, my expectations weren’t so high otherwise.    STORY:  Well, you probably read the short description, while there are some “turns” there are no “twists”, it doesn’t really improve from there. The party just runs kind of aimlessly around and finds some clues about Aura’s origin until the final battle against the bad guy. However I still had fun doing all this. Maybe it is the mix of the character dialogue that I found to be quite entertaining, the change of scenery (which can be ridiculously drastic) or the gameplay. (About the characters: They are all nice and I enjoyed them except for ONE that is. I did not like her, did not like her part of her sub-story, did not ever use her again nor was she ever of any importance to the story – I really do not know why she is in the game at all.)    GAMEPLAY:  I played on normal. For what I experienced the game is more about … well, the experience and story? To be honest, this game doesn’t excel at any category, not the story, not quest variety or battles. However the mix of it all is charming and it does not need to exceed to be fun. And most of it is optional, though you might have problems money wise from time to time if you only follow the main quest line (It is to a certain degree all about the equipment.) Back to being positive, the mix of sub quests, battles and searching for hidden meteors or solving puzzles is fun.     ART:  I liked the whole presentation, everything was so cute. And I liked the little details e.g.    being able to change Aura’s clothing colour, the scenes played out when re-entering the house of a party member …    And while I mostly play with sound turned off, when it was on, I liked it pretty much.  In conclusion, I really like the game and I am probably going to replay it (and skill Aura differently). I think it’s cute and fun.    But I personally was a bit disappointed in how you unlock the second wedding and quite unhappy how the third “wedding” turned out to be. If I had not been intrigued by not one, not two, but three weedings, I wouldn’t even mention this, but well … it did. (I was on team Scarbeck-Kala, man) Ignore this, if you are not girly like me. And the rest still makes up for it all.     Even though I probably sound quite negative about this game,   I recommend it, especially on sale.    I hope this review was of any help to you.",
