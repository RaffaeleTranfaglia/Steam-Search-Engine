    "description": "Developed by 5pb. and Nitroplus, STEINS;GATE was awarded Famitsu magazine's coveted annual Game of Excellence award and was voted one of the most emotionally charged “tear-inducing games” ever made, in a Famitsu poll.　It is a gripping and moving Visual Novel, which has already spawned manga and anime adaptations.",

            "review_text": "If you read this review you are probably like me and watched the Steins;Gate anime before for whatever reason stumbling across the visual novel on steam and are asking yourself now 'Is this game still worth buying even though i know all the major plottwists and the true-route?'  The short answer is in my opinion: yes it is. If you enjoyed the anime as a whole and not just the first or the second half, it's definetly worth buying for multiple reasons.  First of all the game gives you a lot more information on the time-travel stuff that's going on and even discusses some theories that are actual theories in real-life and it's pretty well researched by the devs. However it never goes that deep into science that you, as a normal person, cannot understand what the characters are talking about. So it's really well blalanced and gives you something to think about while reading.  Second the characters get a lot more depth. I guess that shouldn't come as a surprise, that a visual novel with around 50 hour length develops the characters much more than the anime with around 8 hours. However not just that the side characters like Faris, Lukako, etc. get more depth they also get their very own ending route, that, even though it's non-canonical, is worth experiencing.  Third the art and the soundtrack in this game are awesome. But if you've watched the anime and checked the screenshots above the review section you should know that already.  Fourth the inner thoughts of Okabe gives you a lot more insight on how he goes through this whole journey. Even though the anime does a good job in portraying how he kinde descends into madness because of the constant time-looping, reading about his inner thoughts gives you a much better picture about the whole situation. Also having his phone accessable and reading his e-mail exchange with the fellow characters is pretty well done.  Fifth you support the devs. I mean even if nothing from the above convinced you to buy the game because the price is too high or you are still not sure, just wait for winter-sale or something and buy it then, even if it's just to support the devs. They just recently released the Steins;Gate 0 visual novel and it might get a steam release as well, if the support is big enough here. Who knows...  All in all it was a really nice experience to read through the novel, even with prior knowlege of the anime. Sure it does spoiler the major plottwists for you, however it shouldn't hinder the enjoyment you get out of the game.  Also sorry for possible grammar-typo mistakes, english is not my first language.",

            "review_text": "I bought this game on Steam only to encourage Devs &amp; Publishers porting more games WITH JP interface and texts. For Gods’ sake, I got tired of those ports that cut JP texts (Seinarukana) or even Voice Casting (I’m looking at you, God Eater). If they need to cut costs, cut elsewhere. By excluding something has already been in the game, they are limiting player’s choices / options. I do not support companies who earn money at consumer’s lose.  I played every game in Science Adventure Series, so please ignore the play time…  This is the one and only STEINS;GATE game you need / should buy, ever, all those fancy sequels are just superfluities. STEINS;GATE is perfect-ish enough, they should learn to leave well alone. The same goes with CHAOS;HEAD.  This port is not based on the original PC version, but the PS3 HD version. Therefore, it has arguably better graphics, a slightly different interface, and wonky controls.",

It keeps the player interested to play more and more. Character development is spot-on and build up is great!! (And I still haven't experienced the multiple endings)  Graphics are beautiful and embrace style perfectly. 10/10  Gameplay: Although I liked the phone trigger gameplay, I personally prefer more involvement. Nevertheless it's engaging and fun to play.  Overall: 9/10. I would recommend this game to all visual novel lovers, Anime lovers and in general everyone who loves games with a rich story.   ",

If you want a good read, you really can't go wrong here. Even if you've seen the anime, there's so much more depth to the plot in VN form. If you really like the VN genre, pick it up now. If you're unsure, just wait for a sale to lessen any potential buyer's remorse.",

            "review_text": "This is hands-down the best time-travel story I have ever seen and quite possibly the best one I'll ever see in my life.  The story starts off leaving the player with quite a few questions and then proceeds to carry on with all of the characters just messing around and having fun with only only a little bit of foreshadowing hinting towards bad things to come, making the player THINK that this will be some kind of happy slice-of-life-y kind of thing... AND IT HAPPENS...  [REDACTED] HAPPENS... IT HAPPENS SO FAST THAT IT HITS YOU LIKE AN FTL-ENABLED TRAIN APPLIED DIRECTLY TO THE FOREHEAD.  This game gets DARK, as in DARK AF. So if you can't handle the feels, then GTFO right now, but if you can then the only reasonable course of action is to immediately play this masterpiece of time-travel sci-fi. It's get so dark, that the main character, who at the beginning of the game is this funny and eccentric guy who pretends to be a mad scientist, has PTSD in the next game.  If you are of those people who, for whatever reason, can't or won't take the time to read through a whole VN, then watch the equally as good anime.  10/10 would feels again.",

The art style is a nice take on the traditional manga/anime graphical tropes and the true conclusion is among the best I've seen in a narrative game. The twists are well done. The voice acting is impressive. The characters are well written. The game successfully tries to stay interactive thanks to its phone mechanic. But the most likeable achievement of the game is the way it sticks with its own rules regarding time travel. No deus ex machina here : it's all cause and consequence.  However, the game is pulled back by a set of small issues, none of them being gamebreaking though. The awesome soundtrack is poorly managed during some scenes and the number of tracks sometimes appears to be scarce. There are also frequent pacing issues : the game does take its time to take off, and it's not helped by the scientific babble that doesn't always come in handy. Don't mistake me : bringing science into video games is awesome. But that should be done in a way that does not alter the experience (so that people might eventually get interested in it).  8/10",

During my roughly 45 hours as i write this review i haven't felt bored or disengaged with the story. Not much else to say other than all the characters are all fairly well written and their interactions with eachother are great and the soundtrack is probably one of my favourites of any game.  Also the anime is pretty good too",
