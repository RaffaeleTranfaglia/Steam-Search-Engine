            "review_text": "The original Deus Ex is one of the best games ever made, so when Invisible War suffers from a bad reputation, I assumed it was undeserved. I assumed that it would at least be 'pretty ok', and that its poor ratings were due to people comparing it to the first game. Holy cow, was I wrong.  This game is atrociously bad, and not just compared to its older brother. It's genuinely a waste of time and money completely by itself. In short: Had I known how frustratingly bad Invisible War was, I wouldn't even have picked it up for free.  Some of the bad parts (no real spoilers):  - The writing. While the story builds on Deus Ex, you get no build-up, no twists (excepting a few incredibly obvious attempts), no suspense, no room for wondering or doubting. You're never allowed to be curious about the world, the backstory or the events of the past, as most of this is just dumped bluntly at your feet. At one point you walk into a bunker, find some high-level people, and out of nowhere these complete strangers start telling you about their deepest, darkest secrets.  - The pacing. At times, people will warn you that 'someone has a secret agenda for you', and you can be certain that within two minutes that same 'someone' will give you a call to explain their agenda for you, right to your face.  - The level design. Pretty much every single level is a tiny, cramped area. For reference, the 'ton Hotel in Deus Ex is one of the smaller levels in that game, but it would easily fit in as one of the larger levels in Invisible War. This means you'll enjoy a lot more loading screens a lot more often, but it also makes the game feel so much more shallow: When security HQ is 15 meters from the doorstep of the terrorists, suspension of disbelief drops like a rock. It also means walking through four levels blasting bad guys, then walking back through four empty levels.  - The loading screens. Loading time is usually not an issue for me, with a fast SSD in a fast PC. Invisible War doesn't care. Every so often it goes through a complicated series of steps to load a new level, which includes shutting down the rendering engine to flash you your desktop for a few seconds, then going all white for a while as it restarts, and then it starts actually loading, which takes another 10-15 seconds.  - The number of loading screens. In one typical part of the game, you go through a door - loading screen - across a square - loading screen - across a room to talk to someone, then back out - loading screen - around a corner and down a street - loading screen - down some stairs, talk to a guy, and then retrace the whole route with all the loading screens all over again. Steam tells me I've had the game running some 12 hours, but my save game clock tells me I have 7,5 hours playtime. Including a little menu browsing, that means I have likely spent a quarter of my ingame time looking at loading screens.  - The AI. It is so bad it can sometimes be an involuntary source of rare fun. At one point, members of two opposing factions are involved in a firefight, while a couple of guards stroll idly through the crossfire, taking no notice. As the fight ends, the same guards suddenly freak out over the bodies at their feet - 'Ah! A body! There's been a murder! You won't get away with this', they exclaim, and then just keep walking. On a different occasion, an NPC shoots another NPC, and then freaks out over the body *which he just made*. 'There's been a murder!' - no, really? And that's saying nothing of the shoddy combat AI, nor the incredibly poor search AI. You can actually hide from enemies by standing on the other side of a glass door, or by closing an air vent cover, and they will have no idea where you went.  - Graphics – and I don't mean 'it's ugly', I mean it's really poorly designed. Most weapons are close to identical both when equipped and as inventory icons. With a few exceptions, it's hard to tell what things you can pick up in the field really is (except blinky and futuristic). Are those credit chips, datacubes, or maybe weapon modifications? Who knows! Better break into this locker to find out.  - User interface. Of all the compromises made to make this game possible to run for its intended Xbox, this is likely the worst. Honestly, the UI of Invisible War is worse than trying to do internet banking with a broken gamepad.  I could go on for a long time - this is in no way a complete list - but honestly, if you still think it 'can't be that bad', go right ahead and buy it. Or save your money, go on YouTube and find a 'let's play' video. I enjoyed some 25 hours of fun on my last Deus Ex playthrough. In Invisible War, it took me less than 8 hours to reach the 2nd to last level. Then I just decided I couldn't be bothered, uninstalled it, and would rather just read about the ending than suffer through more.",

            "review_text": "I'm a die-hard fan of this franchise, and after playing Deus Ex and Human Revolution, I decided to give this game a shot.  Storyline wise, I feel like it failed to live up to the complexities of plot associated with the Deus Ex title. When I saw that one of the side quests was about coffee sellers, I was a hightly underwhelmed. Of course, it being Deus Ex, they found a way to make such a trivial thing a part of a more meaningful framework, and that, however, was the impressive part. Such a silly thing was used as an illustrator of the absolute means of control that was in place by the Illuminati.  The numerous options of progressing in the game were a plus, however. Invisible War's faction system that provides you with different groups to give your loyalty to, and the ways that these groups may still ask you to do things that make you uncomfortable are an impressive reflection of the not-so-black-and-white situation of being affiliated with any group. I appreciated the faction system and their contrary objectives in a given stage.  Gameplay was a bit clunky though. That ring-shaped HUD, for one, was a massive, epic fail in my opinion that obscured far too much of the line of sight than I would have liked. Additionally, the limitations on the holding capacity were just silly. Beyond this, the game didn't give you much of an opportunity to stick to a non-lethal approach when it came to the armoured Templars. There was absolutely zero way for you take them down without blowing them up.  There were a few things I really thought were good. I really liked the spiderbombs and the Mag Rail. I really liked the differences in the storyline that you could encounter depending on if you were playing as a female character or male one. I also really, really loved all of the little storyline details that connected the first and second games, such as the Gunther Hermann Skul-Gun request. The reproduction of the original stages and transgenics were also nice to see. I like how those details were reworked into this game.  All in all, if you were a massive fan of the first game, this one might be worth playing if you just want to see what they managed to do with the plot. It might not be an enjoyable experience, but it might give you a sense of achievement, and might be entertaining to see how they address some of the details that went into the first game.",

            "review_text": "I have no idea how this game has a metascore of 80. It was a 67 at best when it was brand new; it's aged badly since then. It suffers badly from having been designed for the memory and control constraints of the original X-Box. The levels are cramped and ugly. The field of view is far too tight (and requires using a hex editor to manually edit memory values in the executable to change to something tolerable). The guns are forgettable (with the exception of the gun mod that makes glass windows dissolve instead of shatter, that was mildly amusing) and all draw from the same universal ammo pool. Worst of all the main story is plain old tripe that not only does not hold up well to scrutiny but which commits the sin of trivializing the first game's ending by declaring that all three mutually exclusive endings in Deus Ex 1 happened simultaneously. By watering down and blending three very distinct and different endings they weakened and cheapened the story space for both Deus Ex 1 and Deus Ex: Invisible War.  The three main factions in the game, the Templars (hypocrtical neo-Luddities in power armor), the Illuminati (representing capitalist concerns), and the Dentons (who are trying to properly finish the Helios ending from Deus Ex 1) are all easy to hate. By the middle of the game I was annoyed with all of them. By the end, I decided to actively sabotage everyone, giving me the Omar Trader ending where the world burns in an apocolypse and Russian cyborgs end up ruling the cinders. I was actually happy with that, since the 'good' endings required working with characters I had come to despise.  On the up side, the game does have a somewhat interesting side story about a corporate war between two coffee chains. This was in no way a worthy sequel to Deus Ex 1, and would have been a better game if it'd been divorced entirely from that intellectual property.",

            "review_text": "Granted, the maps are small, the UI is odd, and the game does NOT look like the screenshots in the steam store (must be screenshots of a mod or something), but Deus Ex: Invisible war, is overall a good game. The game needed 5 minutes of work after it was installed on my Windows 10, i7, gtx1080, but I solved the problem I had (where game was always in window mode but not filling the whole screen since I kept seeing my desktop which was annoying) by selecting the second highest resolution in the graphics options and that solved the issue for good. Since then I had no issues. Each time the game loads however your screen flickers around as if you would crash back to desktop, but the game each time gets a grip of itself and the map still loads normally, thus, I so far did not even have one game crash, as it runs smooth and stable.  The graphics are very good for a game of that time period, but be aware, this is a much more simplified version from Deus Ex. No more manual input of codes, no more lock picks (multitool does all), no more different ammo types, as MAKO is the only weapons manufacturer which all require the same ammo type (whether a pistol or a rocket launcher). The voice acting also had a bit of a downgrade compared to its predecessor, so let's say the predecessor was a 10, this here would be a 7. For instance, when you traveled to Hong Kong in the predecessor, all NPCs spoke English with a Chinese accent, but this time when you go to Germany or Egypt, most still speak with American accents but there are NPCs that speak English with Arabic or German accents as well. If such minor details do not concern you, you will still love the voice acting. If you play as a male (Alex Denton), your voice seems very tired, which can be a bit frustrating, but then again, the rest of the voice acting is still top notch for today's standards!   Graphics as mentioned before are good. But too bad no more in-game animations like in Deus Ex, where you could see your chopper fly off. Another minor detail but I believe it added a lot of quality to a game for its time, and now it is gone. You just click your aerial transport (Jet or Helicopter, you pick your pilot!) and that is all. Then again, each pilot drops you off in different locations, which was kind of neat, but then again, with the maps so small it won't really matter.  Weapon controls. This is a bit of a disappointment. It is extremely easy to kill now as compared to the predecessor, and another downside is that they completely removed the skill system, so you have the same shooting abilities from the start to the end of the game. Also, you carry much fewer mods than before, and upgrading your mods is extremely easy, so you are already at max strength before even reaching mid-game. If that is good or bad, you tell me, but I liked it better when I used to be JC.  tl;dr:  Pros: + Continous great storyline right after where the predecessor ended (Key point in Deus Ex universe!!!) + Still pretty good voice acting overall + Some nice locations! + Fun side quests + You can sometimes make some funny choices!! + Sound in the night clubs! Real Band known as 'Kidney thieves'. Good stuff! + Plenty hours of gameplay for the price.  Cons: - Apparently unstable in many systems. Took me 5 mins for it to work well, others apparently need more time. - Small maps. - Simplified weapon usage - no skills, no lockpicks, multi tool does all now.  - Overall simplified game from its predecessor.  - Much more linear gameplay than predecessor. - Less Augmentations and augmentations very easily upgradeable (simplifying game). - Less in-game notes (less newspapers, books, texts, logs, screenshots, etc. In Deus Ex you really felt the conspiracy, here not as much).  My advice:  If you just just got into Human Revolutions and then Mankind Divided and find yourself intrigued by the Deus Ex story, then pick up Deus Ex GOTY edition which runs smooth, enjoy that amazing classic, and then afterwards, play through this game as well. Both are worth the money and the first Deus Ex has probably the best replay value for any Single Player game of all time, I play it once a year since 15 years and each time still encounter new hidden areas and locations and outcomes!!! It is incredible!",

            "review_text": "Deus Ex: Invisible War is a fun game, and it stays true to most of the things that made Deus Ex so incredible; however, it seems to be an overall downgrade. Here is a list of some of Deus Ex: Invisible War's major shortcomings compared to it's predecessor: -The loading times are much more severe -The levels are less open and feel more like a series of long hallways than an open map -Important statistics for various items and abilities that used to be displayed in the menus are no longer viewable, which harms the RPG aspect of the game significantly -The upgrade systems for weapons, biomods, and your character in general have been harshly simplified and minimalized so that they now lack many of what I considered to be essential aspects of the first Deus Ex -The game has a lot of bugs that make it difficult to play, whereas the first Deus Ex game was relatively glitch free -The game no longer features equipment (which, granted, felt relatively useless for most play-styles) -The notes and various acquired data is less detailed and less diverse; I frequently come across duplicate datapads and books, whereas every datapad and book in the original Deus Ex was unique -You can no longer assign custom keys for biomods or quick save/load, which is surprisingly tedious in the middle of combat when I have to hit “fn + f6” just to activate my enhanced speed mod, when I’d much rather hit “v” like I could in the first Deus Ex game -Acquired data, passwords, and passcodes are no longer saved and viewable at any time. Additionally, passwords and passcodes are no longer managed by a player, and the player never has to enter or remember passwords or passcodes in the game. This especially bothers me, because having to manage passwords on your own made hacking feel more like actual hacking, like an achievement of the player. I’d always find myself searching a room for clues as to what a password might be, which felt cool, but I never do that in Deus Ex Invisible War. -You get so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ money within the first 5th of the game that it loses it’s value. Every other mission or “quest” in the game gives you money, and your rarely use it.  There were some improvements, however. that Deus Ex: Invisible War made to the original game: -The stealth system is more complex and requires more strategy than the first Deus Ex -There were many new and interesting weapons and biomods, which give the player even more gameplay options, many of which were very fun to play around with -The game utilizes factions and loyalty systems to add a level of depth to the RPG experience -The graphics, obviously, are much better -The ragdoll physics are really cool, and they make moving bodies way more fun -The game allows you to play as a female, which is nice -The characters are slightly more developed, though completely static (as in the first game) -I imagine that for most people, it’s actually very convenient not having to manage passcodes and passwords themselves -The narrative in Invisible War is a bit better and more central to the game. In the original Deus Ex, I remember the story being very rough, and the characters to flat to care about. The narrative isn’t great in Invisible War, but it is an improvement.  That was, of course, just a brief list of changes made between Deus Ex 1 and Deus Ex: Invisible War. Even that, however, is likely more information than necessary. In all honesty, there are only a few things to consider if you’re thinking about buying this game: did you really enjoy the original Deus Ex? If the answer is yes, than you should buy this game. As a fan of the first Deus Ex, I thoroughly enjoyed Deus Ex: Invisible War. I would say that the original Deus Ex was better, but Invisible War is still a good sequel that does not betray the aspects that made the original so good.

            "review_text": "I spent a long time not believing that this game could be that bad. I'd read countless reviews of how this game was a disappointment, tried to familiarize myself with its flaws without spoiling the story for myself, and made my decision: I would buy it when it went on crazy sale. $1.40 was sale enough for me. I don't regret the purchase, but I don't recommend the game, and the reasons are manifold.  First, ignore any review that says 'if this game weren't a Deus Ex game, it would be regarded better'. No. Even ignoring the Deus Ex aspects, what you're left with is a ♥♥♥♥ poor shooter with a trashy story, ♥♥♥-ugly character models, glitchy gameplay, and poor mechanics choices.   This game is both figuratively and literally a narrow hallway. Half of the time, you're dropped into an area that has little to no hiding spaces and relatively few alternate paths. What few areas do have alternate paths to your objective are circular and do a poor job of telegraphing that you're going backwards. The area maps are practically microscopic, and you're hard pressed to go even three minutes of normal gameplay without having to load up a new area. This makes exploring a chore, so after the first hour of gameplay I gave up and decided I would just plow through the story and get it over with. Also, just by the way, there's a glitch where the game crashes to the desktop or hangs on a black screen during every loading screen, and upon reaching the final area, it has crashed for me five times with no possible fix in sight. Just a heads up if you really want to try to see this through.  So, let's talk about the story. Where Deus Ex was a political commentary through the eyes of a conspiracy theorist, Deus Ex: Invisible War is a sociopolitical commentary through the eyes of a gender studies major, and if I let my inner conspiracy theorist come forward, I might just have to say that this is one of the first games ruined by the thoughtless inclusion of female main characters for the sake of having more 'gender diversity'. Default avatar gender? Female. The Order? Female dominated. WTO? Majority female.   Borderline genocidal maniacs/nazi looking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ templars? Male leader, almost completely male dominated organization. All of that aside:  You're cast into the world of Deus Ex: Invisible War by being treated to an uncanny valley cutscene the likes of which only 2003 CGI can produce. A faceless terrorist unleashes grey goo on Chicago and later you're told it was fire. That's all well and good though, because Chicago isn't important, you're in Seattle, in what is essentially a high school anime gone wrong. With no warning or buildup, the Tarsus academy is under attack by 'the Order', a group of religious zealots who think jihad is the way to go. You can follow orders from these maniacs later, while their second in command tries to convince you that they are indeed a religion of peace by explicitly asking you to murder their targets. Conversely, you can do the bidding of the World Trade Organization, who sits comfortably at the other end of the spectrum at what seems to be Lawful Neutral at worst. Following orders from them doesn't always feel right, but it doesn't make you feel like a sociopath.  It takes hours of gameplay to be drawn in even the smallest bit, and the writing never really recovers. Even the endings feel halfassed, though if you stew on them for long enough, they're just thought provoking enough to be worthy of discussion if you're bored.  Overall, this game is bad. Not because it's an unworthy successor to much better game, but because it barely stands up as a game. It is nothing more than a seven hour long walking simulator with guns added here and there for flavor.",

Doesn't add to the plot at all either, as the other games were set before this one. Let's start with the Protagonist (I can't say 'Player character' because there is absolutely no trace of character to be found in Alex D.) Nothing but a dull monotone voice and a refusal to commit to anything. 'I'll think about it' is a catchphrase which Alex often repeats, but sadly this thought never leads to any resolution. Alex never truly expresses an opinion about anything, or takes a stand for any of the rival factions on offer. After the numbness of the main lead. the bland voice acting is another point where nobody seems willing to stand out. It's like a scene out of Equilibrium where everybody is terrified of showing some emotion, even when trying to convert you to a religion. The many factions set against each other are equally apathetic. If you decide to gun their agents down for no reason and steal their stuff, or even to trash an entire building of theirs, they'll forgive you if you run a small fetch quest for them, and if you decide to slaughter them all again, they won't hold a grudge. All of this combines to stifle any RPG aspects of the game. There's no role to play, and even if there were, there are no real choices by which to express that role.  The anti-rpg agenda is continued by the removal of skill points and even ammo types. Your crossbow takes exactly the same ammo as your rocket launcher, which results in tactical choices being minimised. If all of this isn't bad enough to put you off, all the maps are ridiculously tiny, and yet still take over 90 seconds to load. In a fetch quest within one building you will literally spend more time on loading screens than in the actual game. IF it ever actually loads, and doesn't Crash to Desktop.",

Ready to play.  If I could play.  After the opening scene, and finishing my 'character customization', I started the game, to which it decided to hang.  And then I lost control of my mouse. And my system started crashing.  After hours of frustration, I found that the most likely cause of my woes was the game attempting to use all CPUs on my PC. Luckily, I was well aware of how to change affinity, and this was not a hard fix.  But again, the game hung, and my mouse froze, effectively forcing me to force quit the entire game.  While DE2.exe can be changed, it is Ion Launcher.exe that destroys my ability to play. Considering I couldn't actually fix it from the Task Manager (no mouse control = no right click = no affinity change), I went to cmd.exe to try and use imagecfg to sort that ♥♥♥♥ out.  Well, apparently imagecfg doesn't exist on Windows 8.  This is not a negative review for DE2, this is a negative review for Windows 8's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ self.
