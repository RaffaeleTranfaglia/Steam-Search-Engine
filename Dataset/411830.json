I went into this game expecting a half-♥♥♥♥♥ effort when it came to gameplay, because people are obviously buying it because they saw **** &amp; ♥♥♥. But the game delivers!  Now, it can get a little repetitive after a while, and the constant close-ups on the girls will bog down the pace of the fights. The camera could be a lot better as well. I even had it glitch on me once where it went underneath the ground. That was weird. But still, it's serviceable beyond that.  Good game, I recommend it!",

            "review_text": "I'll sum my experience with this game up in two words: 'Surprisingly endearing'.  So, that probably sounds sarcastic, right? Well, before taking the plunge and buying this game, I was really concerned this would be mindless button masher that depended on the gimmick of stripping and bounce physics to be entertaining. Now mind you, the gimmick turns out to be a welcome addition, considering that this game overall is actually fun.   There actually is story to this game, and to me it seemed on par with any fair, generic anime you see around. Is the story weak in small areas? Yeah, but most animes are, so I find it forgivable.   Pro's -Over 20 characters (counting the included DLC), each unique with a quirky personality type and combat moveset. -If you find it too easy, there's a hard mode -Dojo mode lets you do online or AI battles, always a nice addition -An unexpectedly long story, played out from different points of view of 4 ninja schools, each with 5 characters. -A ridiculous amount of buyables/unlockables, allowing for some pretty great customization, up to 4 accessory slots per character.  -Looking at total missions completed, I'm about 15 hours into the game so far, have been focusing on playing Story Missions, and I'm not even halfway done. So, you absolutely will get your money's worth in terms of gameplay time. -The clothing damage and jiggles certainly could not be anything but a Pro.  Con's -The graphics aren't nearly as nice as Estival, a sequel to this game. It's a port of a PS Vita game, though I am told the graphics have been updated to be better than the Vita version. -Some of the story is played out of points of view of characters that tend to prattle on when they narrate. There's going to be a fair amount of narration that you'll probably be skipping and skimming. -With Frenzy mode, it's possible to end some of the NPC battles in an instant due to overwhelming damage. So the longish load times can often make it frusrating.   ------------------ Neat Gameplay Features   -In a battle, you have your basic uniform (whichever one you picked), and your basic moveset (aka the Flash moveset). The more you play with your basic uniform on, the more bonuses and techniques you unlock for Flash -During a battle, you have the option to pick between two transformations, both are very strong, grant new skills, and activating either one fills your HP to full (so use it wisely, as you can't undo it once you've used it in a fight). These two modes you can activate are Yang (Basically your 'super hero' costume) and Yin (Strip down to your undies).  ----------------------------------------------- -This next part I've borrowed from the wiki, just to save you some time, and to show that the combat is deeper than it appears.  Yang: Yang mode is unlocked by utilizing your Shinobi Transformation and Secret Ninja Arts. Maxing out your Yang affinity gives you access to longer combos, Yang moves, an extra Aerial Rave loop, enhanced damage and invincibility on your dash and auto recovery on your Health gauge and Ninja Art gauge. Making you an even tougher target to take down, you will no longer be stunned from being hit.   Yin: Stripping down to your skivvies and going Frantic is what unlocks Yin mode! When Yin mode is fully maxed out, you gain access to a bevy of bonuses, including increased combo length and a longer combo timer, the ability to recover both your Health gauge and Ninja Art gauge by taunting, Yin moves, higher damage, more invincibility frames on your dash and an overall boost in attack power. Additionally, your Limit Break will only consume 5% of your health instead of 10%. However, your defense will take a huge hit, so you better use all that additional offensive power to end the battle decisively!   Flash: Staying in your standard uniform is the name of the game for unlocking Flash mode. No need to strip down or perform a Shinobi Transformation—just fight as you are! Fully unlocking Flash mode grants you higher damage and invincibility on your dash, faster building of your Ninja Art gauge, infinite Aerial Raves, increased timing to pull off a parry, an enhanced guard and an impressive 1.5x increase to both your attack and defense. If all of that wasn’t enough, maxed out Flash mode gives you increased experience and zeni.",

The Vita version was great but this one was even better (mainly because it has better framerate and textures, also all DLC). The port itself works great, very optimized, without any kind of issue (and my hardware it's pretty old). Also, they added some extra options in Config menu, not available in the original Vita game.  I really love this game, and hopefully Estival Versus will arrive here too (that one is even better than this)",

Note: I originally played this on the Vita, and cleared a large percent of it there.  I want to avoid the standard 'This is about blah, and what you do is blah' kind of review, as there are plenty of those here. This review focuses more on the technical side of things.  For comparison, here's my specs:  CPU: Intel Core i5 750 @ 2.66GHz RAM: 6GB DDR3 GPU: Sapphire Radeon R9 280X  Now, the required specs on the store page made it out as if I'd have a hard time playing it, mostly due to RAM and CPU. This is not the case at all. I run it windowed at 1600X900, and it plays flawlessly. No issues performance-wise.  Originally, there were a couple bugs when this game launched. As of December 28th, 2016 (and as of earlier, though I have no recollection of the exact date), all of the bugs I can recognize are fixed. This game still plays flawlessly, and now there's no bugs or glitches one needs to be concerned about before purchase.  This game is perfectly solid. The game runs well, it's even more responsive than the Vita version from running at 60FPS, it's gorgeous at higher resolutions, and it comes with all DLC. On top of that, they seem to have rebalanced things so you unlock outfits and such a little differently to compensate. This is an incredible port and a worthwhile investment.",

            "review_text": "I thought picking this years game of the year was going to be hard.  I was wrong.    All jokes aside i genuinely like these games. After you get past the '10/10 boobs xD' stuff you'll find a really solid beat em' up, with a ton of characters and great customisation. The story is nothing to write home about and the missions really boil down to beating a bunch of generic enemies before a boss. It's super similar to Dynasty Warriors for example due to the large ammounts of enemies on screen.   To spice up the gameplay a bit you have 2 diffrent transformations, that alter your moves and stats (and outfit), and grant you acces to the op af super attacks, wich shred the opponents clothes. The core gameplay is really fun, alltough a bit buttonmashy at times.  There is no shortage of content here. You get 4 story campaings for each faction in the game and individual storylines for each character. The mission structure is almost identical in both modes, but there is plenty of content here for your money. (this is not even counting the multiplayer wich works fine)  I am pleasantly suprised how they handled the PC port of this game. Having played this on the PS Vita, the 60fps helps this game tremendously, since the framerate doesn't ♥♥♥♥ the bed due to the enemies on screen. Combat also feels way more fluid and faster, making the already fun combat way more fun. It could have used more advanced graphics settigns, but im willing to forgive that concidering this used to be a handheld game.  Overral i would suggest giving the game a shot, especially if you are a fan of dumb anime ♥♥♥♥ and musou games in particular. Yes its fancervice-ish af but its also a ton of fun. For me at least these games will always remain as the perfect guilty pleasure game.",

Each of the girls has their own personality and fighting style and the interactions between each of them range from heartwarming, hilarious and occasionally disturbing (in a good way). Even if you're not a fan of games with excessive boobage this game still has solid gameplay to warrant picking up it.  Pros: Plays well even with cheap graphics cards (as others have said) Fun gameplay especially if you're a fan of other beat em up games Different stances give you different movesets, up to 3 for each girl Comes with the DLC characters from the Vita release for FREE! Lots of boobage and butt-oriented camera angles if you're a fan of that (who isn't though tbh?) Main story mode for each school of girls and then individual missions for each specific girl Tons of customization options, there's at least 150 or more options for underwear alone as far as I can see with my progression into the game as well as outfits for their regular stance and shinobi stance, accessories, hairstyles, the whole works  Cons: Not many cons, but I did experience slight slowdown in some big areas but not enough or frequently enough to hinder gameplay Needs a preview option for outfits/hair/etc so I don't have to click on each to see them on each girl  Overall a solid 9.5/10, grab it if you like beat em ups, boobs, or both!",

On the technical side of things the game is locked at 60fps and has a max resolution of 1080p the game still uses the very low res shadows from the vita version that can sometimes take you out of the experience but on the positive side of things it no longer has the slow playstation save system.

Game is easy to pick up, and pretty easy to grasp, a neat variety of characters with their own quirks, plenty of waifu material to go around.  Graphics aren't great if you scrutinize them, but most of the time you're doing cool ninja ♥♥♥♥ so who cares?  Also for those of you more shameless than I, yes, there are boobs, lots of them, there's only two characters who don't have them, and one of them only doesn't have them half the time.  Good amount of customization with the cosmetic items, you unlock more of them as you go through the story to get some decent visual variety going on. Accessories can be placed anywhere with a (slightly clunky) 3d positioner, so you can do stupid things like put a mushroom in between their legs.  There are lots of achievements, and from what i can see they're all pretty decent, for a completionist, this should be a quick, but noteworthy game.  There are online battles as well, I've heard mixed opinions on those, but hey, it's multiplayer at least.  All in all I'd say this is a very solid game, and you should definitely nab it. If you have a PS4, you should also nab it's sequel: estival versus (which may or may not get ported in the future, there's been no news on that yet)  My numerical rating is an 8 out of 10, all the things it tries to do it does well, and there isn't really anything else I could ask of it.

You run around a 3D map fighting a huge amount of faceless enemies until you reach a main (boss) characters. This game have your standard light attack, heavy attack, guard, dash, etc. Where this game differ is how you can activate your ninja transformation. Transforming into your ninja outfit refills your health and make your attacks more devastating. Also another big feature is how outfits will tear away as your lose health until they are left with nothing but there undies on and sometime even less. But don't worry, they got censors (damn it...)  Honestly the gameplay is can get repetitive especially if you don't like beat em up. But where the replay ability and life of this game is the collectible outfits and items. You can buy outfits and change your characters into a huge amount of items and outfits. You can change them from hair style and outfit, down to what type of underwear they wear.

This is going to be less a review of the game by itself and more a summary of what about this game merrits a purchase as well as a comparison to the Vita version.  This game is the epitome of don\\'t judge a book by it\\'s cover. On the outside, it looks like a blatant fanservice vehicle with excessive jiggle physics for scantily clad ninja ladies. While there is definitely a good amount of echi here, it is the least important aspect of the game. At heart, it is a 3d brawler similar to Dynasty Warriors or DMC, with great gameplay across a variety of maps and enemies with lots of selectable characters whom all play differently. The visuals, even for a Vita port, look fantastic and run consistently smooth. The music is probably my favorite part of the series with lots of rock and dance music infused with traditional japanese instruments and orchestral elements. The translation is the MVP, though: XSEED has done a phenomenal job infusing outrageous premises with incredibly self-aware humor. As I so often say, it is its own fanfiction. And even with all the laughs going around, there are still plenty of moments where you might feel your heart swell just a tiny bit.  Compared to the Vita version, this one completely blows it out of the water. Visually and performance-wise, it\\'s on par with the PS4 version of Estival Versus. It isn\\'t completely bug free, but the worst things you\\'ll encounter are some shaky character models and maybe a moment or two where the camera hates you. It is missing the more gimmicky features like the microphone skirt blow or the other way to enter frantic mode, but honestly that really isn\\'t anything you\\'d notice missing anyway.  There\\'s a ton of content, probably 20-30 hours worth easily with the main storyline and Shinobi Girl\\'s Heart missions. I haven\\'t had a chance to try the multiplayer yet but it seems stable and adds more replay value to the title.  The fact that all of the DLC is included for a price that is less than the version on the Vita costs is icing on the cake. The dressing room is extremely in-depth, if that\\'s your thing. If you\\'re into brawlers or like games with a great sense of humor, or even if you\\'re just interested in the eye candy (which there is a good amount of, even if it isn\\'t what I think makes the series incredible), you should definitely check out Shinovi Versus!",

            "review_text": "I'm gonna break down this review in two sections. One for people who are new to the series and one for those who already played it on Vita.    For newcomers    The biggest question for anyone who is not familiar with the series is 'Is there anything besides T&amp;A to these games?' and the answer to that is a definitive 'Yes!'  Senran Kagura games' two strongest points, at least in my opinion, are combat and characters.  Combat is quite simple and satisfying, combining the battles against hordes of various mobs and against other playable characters. The fighting is fast, colorful, and responsive. Each character has a truly unique playstyle and each player will be able to find their own favorite. There are speedsters, like Ikaruga and Hikage, brawlers, that rely on powerful, chargeable attacks, like Katsuragi and Yozakura, there are fighters that prefer to fight at the distance, like Mirai, and there are some quirky and cheesy fighters that rely on status effects, like Haruka.   Characters are simply awesome. And I don't mean it in a 'good for an ecchi/fanservice', I mean legitimately frigging awesome. Each character is truly unique, with great backstory, likable and varied personality, memorable quirks, and superb interactions with other cast members. They all are truly developed (pun intended) individuals that will make you love them. The addition of individual little story missions for each character also helps as it showcases them in various humorous situations.  However, this particular game is not without its flaws. The difficulty curve is a little bit unbalanced. You're free to replay missions to level up your characters, but doing so even for a little bit makes future missions incredibly easy. There's also small variety in missions in general. Each time your mission is just 'Kill all mobs, move to the next area, kill all mobs, defeat the boss'.     In short     + Simple, colorful, fast paced, and satisfying combat   + Great characters   + Unique and varied gameplay for each cast member   + Buttload of customization options   - Unbalanced difficulty curve   - Repetitive missions   I was also once a newcomer to the series and I was quite prejudiced against it based on its presentation. After giving it a try, however, I was able to see that there's much more to it. While all the titilation is always on the forefront, at some point you either stop paying attention to it or (just like characters in the game) start treating it as a joke. Basically, if you are interested, just give it a chance. You just might want to stay in this hometown.    For those who already played it on Vita.    Smooth as butter 60 FPS framerate and all DLCs. That's all I needed to pick up this game again. The framerate really does wonders enhancing the gameplay.   So stop wasting your time and buy it! If we lucky they'll port Estival Versus next!

Just strip them of their dignity and clothes. Generic enemies are made to be plowed through a la Warriors/Musou. Big bad one on one fights are more an exchange of juggles, counters, and special attacks slightly more reminiscent of something like an Ultimate Ninja Storm game or something. It's all hack-n-slash either way. The story mode is basically a visual novel with battles mixed in. There's plenty of missions as well as unlockable outfits, and such to give it some pretty decent play time. It's actually pretty fun stuff. This isn't my first dive into the series and it's kept me coming back so far. I give it a solid 3 badonks and half a pair of jiggly jubblies out of 5.",

The answer is maybe. The PS4 version is 50$ BUT has more content and more girls in it. I recommend on shelling out the extra 20 bucks for the extra ♥♥♥♥ i mean content. But really this is a fairly fun fighting game if you dont mind the nudity of course(probably the only reason anyone would get this game TBH). But i really would lean on recommending the PS4 version over the pc if you have a PS4. If you dont have a PS4 go right ahead and try it out on the pc. And if you dont like it well you can just nicely ask gabe for your money back.   ~ 7.7/10 (Overall Game)",

            "review_text": "Fun little button mashing title. Where each level consists of eith a 1v1 boss fight or a few waves with limited level movement and then a boss fight usually with a mob. You gain exp and lvls from fighting with each character as well as other attributes. Combat isn't especially deep but specials and strip finishes can be quite satisfying. Found the story and writing to be suprisingly good. Didn't really touch multiplayer. Played just enough to get trophys using bots. overall a fun little game to play in small bursts. Not really the sort of game you can play for extented periods of time.",

            "review_text": "the game is basicly like naruto storm 4 when you fight more then one enemy at a time only better add more combos like theres like only 6 person in a single mode and how do you even get the cutscene when the game actually has to censor and if you could pou like a guide on how dress breaking works that would be good to. and fix walking in the school cuz it looks so bad if i wanted bad walking I would be playing call of duty. game is solid and if you can keep playing the girl mission you can get your girl to a high enough you can kill the boss in single combo and idk but the game should add marai but she could be in it.i give this 9/10 would fap again lol",

            "review_text": "A fairly simple beat-em-up with a likeable cast of characters and lots of oppai appreciation.  By the way, when people say they play this game for the plot, they're only half-joking. The premise is unironically pretty engaging, and the characters' backstories were emotional enough to make me tear up on a couple of occasions. This is coming from someone who only once teared up at Katawa Shoujo, which is widely considered to be some pretty heavy-duty feels.  Anyway, for all the joke reviews, memes about fanservice, and mediocre scores on Metacritic (I mean, we all know the AAA studios pay off the reviewers anyway, right?), it's actually a very solid game. £22.99 (or $29.99) is a little steep for something from early 2013, though, so if you've got a Vita or a PS4, you're probably better off grabbing Estival Versus instead for a little extra.   Also worthy of note is that the multiplayer is perpetually dead. So unless you have designated friends to play with, don't just buy it for that. If you want a long and engaging campaign, though, the game delivers.  Simply put, grabbing Shinovi Versus on sale is a decision you'll only regret if someone walks in on you playing it. Turn your volume down and keep your finger on your monitor's power button if you hear someone descending into your basement lair.",
