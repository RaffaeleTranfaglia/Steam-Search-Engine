            "review_text": "Good game. Highly recommended for fans of platformers.  The story is decent though I felt that it lacked something. Can't quite put my finger on what exactly it lacked but it kept me interested long enough to actually complete it. At first I tried to play using just the keyboard but quickly switched to my gamepad.  NOTE: I recommend using a gamepad as it makes some of the tighter places in the game much easier to reach.  One complaint I have is that you can't change the controls. I would rather have used the triggers for the run ability and whenever I pushed the thumbstick in, the game paused causing me to die after I resumed the game. A couple of places in the game I glitched out and had to restart the level which was a little annoying. Luckily the levels are not that big so not much progress was lost.  The game is fairly short but enjoyable. Can't say it has much replayability but I only paid $2.00 for it so I'm not complaining. I like the allusion to a sequel at the end. If you buy it and play it you'll see what I mean. I do hope there will be a sequel but this time around a little more focus on the overall story would be very nice. One annoying feature of the game, when you die a number of times the background changes color and throws shadows on the game which sometimes makes it harder to play. Sometimes it's raining, which doesn't make much difference to the way the character interacts with the world but is annoying. Key solution? DON'T DIE!    Spoiler    If you do buy this game and play it, note that the Wild Boar boss at the end is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Just keep moving and don't let him or anything he throws touch you and You'll be okay! NOTE: That it's easier said than done!  ",

I kind of wish there were enemies / bosses to fight..it's a pretty basic platformer, all you do is dodge traps. (mostly spikes)  but still a solid game, and I enjoy difficult platformers like these. Definitely worth playing if you are into difficult platformers.  The level design / environments look great as well.   Some downsides:  As you die the brightness / night/day cycle changes, and the 'sunset orange' part makes it VERY difficult to see some traps.  Not much of a story.  The Title of the game is kind of odd. 'Mr. Bree+'",

            "review_text": "Gaaah this game has so many issues. The most glaring is that the wall jump mechanic is *awful*. Really, purely, one of the worst wall jumps I've ever seen in a platformer. Doesn't tend to work properly is most of the problem... gets pre-empted by double jump a lot. As well, there's some problematic level design; Level 5 and Level 60 both stick in my mind as having the biggest issues, but there's a lot scattered throughout.   But... on the whole it's generally okay. Not amazing, but for the price you pay it's not overcharging you or anything. The levels are generally pretty nice, a lot of mechanics and decent variety. It's competent, at the very least. I enjoyed it as a whole. Still far from perfect but I can tell the devs at least put their heart into it.",

Maybe when I get my controller working, this might be different.",

Though, I could play it a bit(even with lag) and at full speed, it would probably be very fun and dynamic, so I still recommend it.",
