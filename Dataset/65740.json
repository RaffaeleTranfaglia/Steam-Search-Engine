Definitely needs a polish, but the core mechanic is down - and it's a joy to mess around with!  Cons: - The AI in particular drives me up (and into) the f**king wall! Losing missions because your blonde-driver Walruses can't drive 10m forwards and shoot the enemy, without backing up 50m, turning around three times, getting stuck in a wall, and being slammed into by my other Walruses... ♥♥♥♥ gets old REAL quick.  - The infantry feel of the game is just horrid - ♥♥♥♥♥♥ guns, movement feels too fast, and still glitches in random places, slowing you down and making progress difficult. It doesn't even feel unfinished - it feels broken.   Conclusion: Would not recommend. Too incomplete, and AI kills the mood completely.",

The pathfinding is terrible, the combat logic is nonexistent - I regularly found my units being picked apart by enemies they weren't even returning fire at, despite having clear lines of sight) The crying shame is THIS HAS BEEN DONE SO MUCH BETTER BEFORE BY 'HOSTILE WATERS' : A GAME OUT IN 2001!  Just take that in for a second - a game over a decade old, does a better job of this on almost every front. Use THIS game engine and give us the HD re-release of Hostile Waters i've been dying to see, that would have been a much better use of the man hours used to make this abomination.  If you haven't already played Hostile Waters, go get that instead - it's probably harder to get running on modern systems but aside from graphically it's a much _MUCH_ better game.",

It shipped with a few annoying bugs which are mostly fixed today. It has the occassional, though predictive, crash, however II only started to experience those during the later half of the game (after 25 hours of gameplay or so). Pathfinding issues have mostly been resolved, with a few minor exceptions. These issues aside, this game is totally awesome and well worth the €25 it is sold for today. I regret the fact it never got a successor, because the different concept applied in this game are quite awesome.  - Take a sip from your drink while your units do the hard work like refueling and moving to a far away position, and take control as soon as the action happens. - Everything happens realtime. Production needs to be planned in advance because its not instantly ready (for example the production of fuel so you can travel to a different island). And although traveling to a different island does speed up time, you'll have to wait till your ship gets there. As a side effect: there is no loading screen. - Though the amount of different units are rather limiting (though somewhat understandable considering you're commanding a carrier), there are many different upgrades to choose from. - You'll have to take care of some of the logistics yourself, which adds to realism.",

The FPS feel is very clunky and mouse sensitivity was horrible to get used to (never encountered anything like it before) and something about the 'feel' of the first person has made me feel rather sick; yes, physically nauseous which I've never experienced before while playing a game and hence why I put it down so fast.  Story seems very badly crafted story with no real reason for me to care why things are happening. It paints out Asia/Pacific as the bad guys and the more western US as the good guys (wow surprise surprise) and you’re fighting over water on some planet that’s not earth but like earth with earth-like animal’s… but it’s not earth. For some reason they don’t really explain what’s happening and the game seems like it’s a remake for a generation who had played it in the past and want to play it again. This game is NOT designed for those that haven’t played the original in my opinion.  Overall I wouldn’t buy this again; in fact I’d like a refund of my money and time now that I think about it…  Gameplay: 2/10 Graphics: 8/10 Sound: 5/10 Overall: 5/10",

I'm also still astounded by the fact that there's many different weather conditions that affect you, not only in vehicle performance, but for the visual aspect of it, like the fact that a rainstorm makes it harder for you as a player to see what you're doing and the psychological aspect is ESPECIALLY delivered with the weather and environmental depth of the game. very well done!",

Is the only Bohemia title I own that does this.  Am getting a bit into it - enjoyed the 1st person bits - but am much later in the game and can't seem to go on foot. But the vehicles are fun. Initial mouse control is a bit touchy but can be adjusted.  If you are a fan of the original and can get this for ... $15 or less - get it. The strategy is all there and the visuals are nice.

It's like playing a strategy game like StarCraft giving orders in real time viewing the battlefield from the inside! Another good option you have in this game is taking control of the units and playing as an FPS. The ideology is like Hostile Waters, another very good game of the same kind.   The difference between those games are that Hostile Waters had any unit with a specific pilot model called AI. The AI as much missions completes , so much its abilities raise(RPG style). In Carrier Command there is the ideology of complete control through the carrier. SO there is no indidually AI. Just you taking control a specific unit and the others that work automatically. In Hostile Waters AIs was like agents. In Carrier Command we talk about small army.  But as much some people compare it to ARMA game, NO. The Command interface make it a completely different game.

Story - Don't expect much as its quite cliche and the voice acting is not bad but not very good either  Game breaking bugs are something to be considered because in the game you have use the supply barque aka supply ship to resupply your carrier EVEN if you have docked at your supply island where you have all your gear. the problem here inlies with the supply ship which sometimes will glitch and be stuck and no matter what you do to try and trigger it to move again nothing helps.

At 2 or 3 first mission on foot is working properly and after that I was stuck at everything because the body position is too low and getting stuck at everything! as example the leveled floor which should be very thin,about 3 centimeter on the door way which I need to go over it but I was stuck and unable to go further! The solution I found the best is use cheat engine to accelerate the game speed and with it I could climb over the leveled floor and enable my self to climb the stair or some slope which should be able to but I coudn't without cheat engine! to clime the slope I need to enable speed hack x4 and walk in 45 degree of stair abit by abit and if you wanted to buy this game,you better pirate it and I found my self rude because this game ain't worth even 1 buck because the only thing you get from this game is frustrated. I find this game has good strategy and I don't deny that but path finder in this game is ♥♥♥♥! your tank and hit your friend and teamkill,your tank can slip down the mountain and get killed,your tank could hit each other becasue another is blocking the way and they keep pushing each other untill one of them killed,your jet sometime kill it self because they see the mountain as free space and hit the mountain it self,your jet most of the time would flying around without doing anything when you told them to fire at the enemy jet which is shooting at your jet with no reason and I have to control over it!  In this game you would scream over the freeze the crash and how horrible part of FPS part which is forcing you to play it and it's horrible than doom 2(I didn't speak of graphic but at least in doom 2 I can climb the slope with no problem) and in strategy part, you need to baby sitting at every units you have so trust me that you must not waste even 1 buck for this game until the game is fixed because it's BROKEN!",
