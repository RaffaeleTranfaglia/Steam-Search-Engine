Very relaxing to just slide around on the wide areas. The art style is probably not everybodys favorite... still gives a good contrast between floor and skid marks.    Pros:     + Very nice drifting feel/good physics + easy enough to learn, but still a challenge to master + sounds are perfect (great Turbo whistle and blow-offs) + the map has a great selection of places, from a harbour to a mountain lake + the music fits the game perfectly (in my mind) + has 3 modes: Drift Courses, Driftkhana, Mountain Drifts + Leaderboard for the events (weirdly Takumi Fujiwara is on first place)    Cons:     - a bit short - can be very precise with some tricks (wall tap)   !!Dont forget that it was made by only 2 Persons!!    Update Zen Edition:   (16th of August 2016)  The Zen Edition was an Update that brought in a considerable amount of new things to do including:  * A new tutorial mode to help YOU be a better and more skilled driver * Drift Lines, which are a new way to get drift points -&gt; clip them completely for a big point gain * New 'Midnight Challenges' which are mountain drift tracks at night * You can now watch yourself drifting with the new replays * An overhaul of the controls * 'Event Challenges' give you 5 tasks per track, from easy to very hard, to do -&gt; more gameplay * New achievements for the challenges  With the Zen Edition the game gets much more content and some goals you can achieve. And the Midnight challenges give experienced drivers/drifters a real challenge. And dont forget that it still costs the same as before. Also dont forget to...    Keep   Drifting   Fun ",

It doesn't have that much content, but definitely has replay value, if you enjoy the art of drifting.

Cons: This might just be for me, but I plug in any controller, and I'm always turning left, so a few control bugs for controllers (I have restarted my computer after I noticed this problem and it was not fixed, I used both a 360 and XBone controller), very little customization, which shouldn't really be a con because it just came out, so I can understand that.

Modern games tend to be way too simplified in terms of mechanical skill required to play in order to appeal much casual audience as possible. Absolute drift is fairly hard to learn, harder to master while keeping it fun doing that.  + Driving is really damn fun. Pulling out that perfect drift is reward in itself.  + Leaderboards. The main reason of my game time.  + Minimalistic Graphics. Result is a game that is not power hungry and looks nice and clean.  + Soundtrack. Awesome and chill.  + Initial D references and AE86. Love it.   Cons  -If you are looking for story, better go looking at other direction. There isn't one aside being told to become 'Drifting master' at the beginning.  -Short campaign mode of 30-120 minutes depending how you play it.  -Even though having minimalistic graphics i'd really like seeing some scenery around the maps.  -Performance issues in couple of maps.  -For casual play the price point might not be justified for the reasons addressed above.    Overall: Really nice drifting game that hooks you in with it's mechanical play. ",

            "review_text": "Fun little game that is surprisingly hard to master.  Though 100%'ing the game and achievements can be done in a single few hour sitting the quick climb to becoming a 'drift master' is a good challenge. Cars are loose and easy to drift but hard to control. But controllable they are! This results in it feeling quite satisfying when you string together some tricks and turns and get your combo score flying high. But it can be quite frustrating when, more often than not, you don't keep control. The art and music combo is almost hypnotizing as you get mesmerized. But losing control and crashing your vehicle keeps you grounded in reality.  It really could have used a bit more depth. Overall suffers from that feeling of input lag just by it's style of driving. But this bogged feeling, whether my imagination or not, extends to the menus as well. Things could've been more crisp in that respect. And it is quite short. 2.3hrs to 100% for me. Not even enough time to 'farm' all the Steam Cards. I don't feel the need to beat my scores so I don't really see any replayability here. It could've used some sort of racing mode with NPCs or local versus. Would've been a great callback to a MicroMachines or OffRoad feel. Spoiler warning; The ending dialogue hint towards a rally themed sequel gets my nerd senses tingling and I hope to see that realized one day as the base here is exceptional.  There's definitely something here. Maybe not a ton, but something. Fun to be had for an afternoon. A perfect bundle game but might have trouble standing up to scrutiny as a lone purchase.",

Runs perfectly, other than the occasional smoke caused performance drop. Locked at 60fps by default, no option to change it in the settings menu.   Sometimes I feel like the point registering system isn't quite accurate, as you can slide at quite an angle without it ever counting as a drift. Same goes for the point system in the end of a combo - when your combo ends, and you hit another drift just after, it can take quite a while for it to start registering it and giving you points.   I had the infamous Xbox One controller bug on Windows 10 and trying to fix this issue by the standard troubleshooting guide yielded no results, neither did any of the publicly available beta options help. Got in contact the developer and they were kind enough to give the beta code for the Zen edition. After that, no problems. Props for the quick answer.",

A weird thing is that your car  always  leaves behind trails of drift when driving, even in the air. It's very amusing to watch.     Performance   Can run on almost any current and last decade PC.

            "review_text": "One of the best drifting games out there. I think it's underrated. One should really consider it on a sale.   Graphics:  Interesting simplistic concept.  Vehicle control:  Sim-like controls but yet, somewhat arcady. Not very easy to control the car. Which is a good thing for this kind of game.  Music:  Not my kind of music. Weird techno-pop-trance â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ going on.  Cars:  Several vehicles to choose from. They differ in speed and handling. You can paint cars and/or put stickers on them!  Level design:  Absolutely perfect. In the main story (kind of) area, there are buildings, roads and objects scattered around for your pleasure. A lot of different objects to drift around, through, under and between. Then there are also drift tracks.  There are 3 kinds of drift tracks:  *Mountain drift: No laps, you just go downwards while drifting as much as you can. *Driftkhana: No laps. A closed off area where you perform drift moves (donuts, jumps, slaloms, drifts) until the timer runs out. *Drift curcuit: Run 3 laps around while performing drift moves.  Drifting:  Collect points for each drift move. More angle and more speed mean more points. You can chain drifts. Careful for if you lose control, you crash. When you crash, you bank your current points but lose your streak.  Single player:  There 6 areas, each requiring you to complete a number of tasks before unlocking the gate to the next area. Tasks vary between collecting things, completing certain drift moves, jumping over obstacles and some other stuff.  Multiplayer:  There are online leaderboards for all tracks. Try to go higher on each track and see how you fare compared to the general Steam population.  For the lack of good drifting games out there, and my love for drifting games, I give this game a solid 8/10. The reason for the 8 is, the lack of a proper story/mission/campaign thing, and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ music.   Warning, the game is very short. like I went through the whole thing in just under 2 hours, got all the achievements and all that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. So it's very, very short. But it's nice. It's a 'casual' game.",

There's a bunch of drift and driftkhana tracks each with their own leaderboards, so the competitive leaderboard types of players will probably get much more than 90 minutes out of this game. The drift mechanics seem mildly accurate, for a really low-grip world.  Unfortunately the goal detection is kinda dodgy. Where you have to do donuts around an object, you actually just have to be drifting a certain angle, not even in the correct direction, within some radius of the object. You'll accidentally half-complete some objectives driving past it. Drifts to complete objectives don't have to be successful, you can slide past, tick off an objective, and then slam into the wall (the exception to this is that actually hitting clipping points doesn't give points, and donking donut objects sometimes resets them). The result of all this is that you can basically fumble your way through the whole game (you do gotta git gud for the leaderboard modes though).  Also there's a difficulty setting that seems to do nothing. I don't even know.  All up - it's a fun little toy, but it's not really a complete product.",

First off; the drift physics are exactly what you'd want. Throttle is pressure sensitive, allowing you to be very precise with how hard/soft you push the car in a drift. Car sounds are crisp and vary from car-to-car. Handbrake is applied JUST right; some arcade driving games have handbrake engage WAY too strong and sling shot you around. I really dug the Mirror's Edge-like minimalist graphics theme, with red colored items being important against a white backdrop. The game is a bit short w/ 5 'worlds' each with 20 or so challenges to complete that don't take long at all to run through. I am hoping this will maybe receive Workshop support to add things like custom car skins &amp; Events for extended replayability.

This is aimed towards the hardcore crowd, as it takes some time to get good in this game and place well on the global leaderboards.",

            "review_text": "I genuinely wish I could give a neutral review for this one. The game is not bad. In fact, it is very good at what it does.  Absolute Drift is a minimalist drifting game, in which you're a white (can change) car, in a white world, with white objects everywhere. Except for a few things. Orange colored objects are destroyable and/or important. Each 'world' also seems to have another flavor color splashed in periodically. (i.e. Yellow in world 2, Blue in world 3, etc.) And each 'world' you unlock by completing various 'missions' (such as doing donuts, spins, drifting between obstacles, etc.). There are no time limits as far as I can tell, and it's just a very open-world (on a table top), relaxed, easy going drifting game with no rules, no conflict, and no consequences.  All of that, it does EXTREMELY well.   However, it is not FUN. At least not to me. I'm playing on an XBox controller, and I also tried it out on my keyboard. There's five controls. Gas/Accelerate, Brake/Reverse, Steering, and E-Brake. You can also remove automatic transmission and have another shift up/down pair of buttons available. But I found the shifting on this tedious, and without shifting the game is repetitive. You can learn to do all you can do within the first ten seconds of playing. Spinning only works in reverse as far as I can tell, and 'donuts' are just, basically, a slow lazy drift. When you are told to donut something, you can get 10%, crash, and get 10% more, crash, and repeat until complete. I've played plenty of other racing games with drifting components, and a few other drifting-centered games. This one, you have significantly less control over your vehicle. And the way the game calculates a 'drift' you can literally drive straight up to your obstacle and slam on your brakes and succeed in just about any of the 'missions'. There is no incentive I can tell to do well (other than placing higher in the global rankings), and no punishments if you just crash into a wall over and over until you succeed.  To feel successful, one must suceed. To succeed, there must be a chance of failure. To avoid failure, one must learn. Learning is caused by either positive or negative reinforcement, or some combination. This game has none. Perhaps I just suck at this game, but I didn't find it fun.  TL;DR: If you want a laid-back drifting game with no clear rules, where you can just drive around a pristine environment to your hearts content, this is for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere.   #TOFU #JDM #HOON EDIT: It doesn't seem to be recording my time correctly. Anyone who's played it knows it takes longer than '0.1 hours' to get that far.",
