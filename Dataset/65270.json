            "review_text": "At first glance this game looks kind of boring, and when I first looked up game play videos I found a 20-minute video of pounding concrete blocks with a sledge hammer, which made this game look almost as exciting as Duke Nukem Forever. But then I found out about the explosives missions and decided to give it a try.  I had hours and hours of fun playing missions over agin just blowing things up in different ways! I think my favorite mission was the clock tower; if you pack the explosives just right, most of the structure goes skyward and then it rains bricks for a while afterward.  There is some strategy to the explosives, however. In some missions you have to avoid destroying the wrong structures while others require you to avoid making a big mess. (Or, just for the fun of it, you can go ahead and blow everything up and fail the mission.)  There is a variety of missions with different structures and different tool sets and objectives. I found the frontloader and dumptrucks difficult to use because when you're trying to scoop up the debris it doesn't clump up nicely into the scoop, and then when you're hauling the debris, it's feather light and can slosh out of the container like water if you stop too quickly.  After completing all the missions you can replay the older missions with any tools or vehicles you like (including the explosives) and unlock special tools like the repulsor gun.  This game also supports user content, and you can download some add-ons from the developer website, including a rocket launcher.  Another fun thing you can do is edit the tool properties files and increase the explosive power of the explosives!  One problem I had with this game is that the mouse cannot be inverted, but I eventually got around that by using SakasaMouse so that I can properly pitch foward when I move the mouse forward and pitch backward when I move the mouse backward.",

After seeing explosives and actual equipment letting you loose in the game to really be an evil genius is just so much fun. I watched a couple videos before i knew i had to have it and their was even a demo on their site. You make the choice on what you want to use some missions (some missions are limited like no explosives), but trust me its NOT your typical go place it here then make sure you run to this spot, you place it where you want and if you want to go crazy with every explosive you have then your free to. Their are some bugs like their is no damage/health meter, but that just makes it fun when you climb a crane blow the building and travel with the rubbel! Score this 4 Out Of 5!",

            "review_text": "I paid $10 for Demolition Company and it's a fun litte game. On many levels, it's really well-made. The equipment and vehicles are detailed and some of the controls are complex and will take a bit to get used to. The missions are straightforward, don't require anything overly complicated and the tutorials are adequate enough to give you a good understanding of how to use all the machines. I have only one main complaint and that's that the physics need a tweaking when it comes to hauling debris in either your loader or the dump truck. 2/3rds of your hauled materials will bounce, unnaturally, out of your loader's bucket while moving. The same thing applies to your dump truck. Acceleration and deceleration is very herky-jerky and the materials you're hauling will violently shift around and spill out on all sides. I also stumbled upon another physics bug where, using your jackhammer, you can turn oil drums into projectiles, causing them to instantly break apart solid walls.   Overall, the game's worth the 10 bucks. Who doesn't like breaking or blowing stuff up? It doesn't appear the developers have done anything with it in a couple of years, so it seems unlikely they'll address the physics problems mentioned above. They're aren't game breakers... they just cause some frustration and eye rolling.",
