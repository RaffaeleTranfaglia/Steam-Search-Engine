From the date, of the posts that i have seen on it, they are waiting for over a year for an answer. Im ain't gonna wait for that, so i requested for the first time in my life a refund, hope that they are fare in there refunds:)  Bassicly i chekced the reccomendations from people on steam, i noticed that there where some lags and issues here an there. I asumed that it wouldn't bother me with my new pc, but i seems not to.  So you are warned it seems to be a fun game but there are a lot of issues from what i have noticed and seen.   Update: 22-07-2015/ Got the refund i reqeusted. Verry nice from steam thumbs up for that!",

Some of the controls aren't easy to figure out and you're pretty much required to know up front about collectible items, advisors, routes, etc. Meanwhile, there is no useful website or manual to be found anywhere, nor is there an active community. So basically, unless you already know how to play the game from back in the day, don't bother.",
