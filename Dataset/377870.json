You can play a bunch of different remixes of similar levels and fight a bunch of bosses that look more or less the same but with slight differences. There are ten actual different boss designs and they get recolored a bunch to make more bosses. But you can play the arcade mode and it's cool and there is good music... I dunno, it's a weird game and a weird release. Is it worth the price? I don't know if it is. There's definitely a lot of problems with it and it's not, for example, as good as G DARIUS was, but... whatever, it's an acceptable game and you don't HAVE to play all the silly padding levels if you don't want to.         for the fighters",

            "review_text": " A Stereo Space Odyssey well worth your adrenaline     In 1979, I bought Space Invaders for the Atari 2600 for $ 100. I know people who ruined themselves by buying ROMs for the NeoGEo which were five times more expensive - just to have the real 'arcade feeling' at home. Condidering this, the price tag for Dariusburst does not seem as 'outrageous' as some claim.  I spent a lot of time with shooters - but DARISBURST is the most epic I experienced. It's more than the sum of it's parts, it's got a special feeling of its own. The frantic action and the soundtrack draw you into this abstract adventure. I never did drugs, but I think DARIOBURST comes very close to it.  One of the things that I did not like with most other Japanese shooters is the fact that most of them are so short and repetitive. DARIOBURST however gives you endless levels, customations and bosses. You are on an epic mission to... save the world or just go on. You don't buy some levels, but a galaxy full of challenges. ",

Worth it for the soundtrack and revived music from previous Darius titles, alone.  Good luck ever pulling together 2 monitors and 4 friends who actually know how to play this game, though.",

            "review_text": "As a person who has never played this game before or ever even heard of it until very recently, it is a good game. The gameplay mechanics are very solid and enjoyable.   But it falls short in one area which makes the game bland to me, feel free to read on if you want to know.  The gameplay mechanics are there, the dev's nailed everything that a shump should have and more, but for me it was the music that I did not like. I know this is very picky of me believe it or not. If the soundtrack is not good then I won't enjoy the game as much, to me it feels like I'm just moving, dodging, and shooting in Dariusburst; I wasn't engaged it the combat. Compared to other shump's that I own and play, the games maybe not be as good, but the soundtrack is just awesome and I'm just totally absorbed into the game.  The other thing which is very minor that I didn't like is that some nodes/maps in a specific mode can't be played unless you're playing with another player. Thing is, that node/map can be completed by other players who are playing co-op and finish it. This concept is new to me and is a little bit weird, I feel like this mechanic should not be in place, but it is what it is.  Overall this is a very fun game, like I said earlier, the devs nailed all of the gameplay mechanics and is very satisfying to play. Definitely pick this up if you don't really mind about the soundtrack or if you love old-school shump's. ",

            "review_text": "Game works like a charm, and there's a lot of meat in this release. Great for shmup fanatics, but also for those that like to kick back and just play a bit. It's perfect for those quick little bursts of fun!  The port is great, too. However, less than 1920x1080 need not apply, unfortunately.  EDIT: The game starts fast and is a bit like the Binding of Isaac where you can start a game blazingly fast, especially in the CS mode, and just finish a mission or two. You'll feel like you're making tangible progress as you clear more areas.  As you progress, you'll also start getting better and better at the game. Perhaps you'll even get into other shmups.  Anyway, I'm still giving this one a two-thumbs up.  EDIT2: After nearly 40 hours with this game, I'm still nowhere to close to being done with it. CS mode is what I spend the most time on, though I do fire up the AC mode from time to time.",

Dariusburst Chronicle Saviours is a beautiful Shmup that's very fun to play with its over 3000+ Stages and its different Modes where you can play the hole game in one or just parts, It even Support up to 4 player Co-op Fun to mess you with youre Friends or the Online Scoreboard to rain in one of the Top Ranks. Its also is easy to learn for Beginners when you useing keyboard but i would recommend useing an Controller because the full Controller support works great! Also the Game does not need powerfulls PC´s you can use Older ones with no problems. It also Support a 32:9 aspect ratio so if you want to play Dariustburst on Dual-Screens youre free to go and its also an Different experience with the View! I much recomment to try out the CS mode its hard addictive after playing some hours and getting stucked somewhere you just buy another ship with maxed shilds and weapon and there ya go everthing blowup Finaly :D   ",

The music is also stunning and fits the game perfectly!  What are you waiting for buy this game in a heart beat!  Pros: Consider the price of the arcade machine this is a steal! and the PS4 version is £49.99 why would you want it any other way!  Cons:None!

First i would urge people to only purchase this in a half price sale, as its not worth the full asking price.Second i cant believe theres no full screen option in Arcade mode which is a big shame, with all those levels and arcade cabinets to choose from there is so much content.And there is no option to how hard or easy you want the game to be to.Its crazy hard on Arcade mode and game feels like it is running to fast to.  While the graphics are ok they are not amazing to, but just feel like a game from 2006 sort of time. And no option to set them better or to suit the needs of your pc if you have a very powerful rig, with a very powerful GPU to.Just felt in todays time of such powerful hardware they could of included advanced options to make things look alot better.And from past history iam sure from this lazy port, they wont even take any notice of fans complaints about things we would like to see in future updates. The downloadable content for different ships from past games they made is a great edition, but i would of rarther seen a perfect port first, then more downlodable after.  So iam sorry to say that in the games state it is now, i very doubt they will even bother updated any of the complaints and concerns people have with it, which is very sad to say the least, from a game which is ok and not awsome.  As i said in the first part of my review get this at a half price sale, which then the game is just about worth the asking price.  Even though this is a case of good and bad and lots of content as in stacks of levels and DLC packs, iam giving this a thumbs down for now, but really hope down the line they update things which is iam sure going to be a no!.",

            "review_text": "I'm going to state straight away that this is one of the very best shmups ever and one of the greatest games ever made. And, actually, I don't even think it's quite the best Darius game, so that says a lot about how awesome this series is as a whole. As it stands, however, this is the best shmup on all of Steam (yes, even better than Ikaruga and DoDonPachi), and it will be a tough game to topple in terms of future releases.  It's not simply because of the sheer mass of content the game has, which, even if it's repetitive and the aesthetics are not as colorful and trippy as previous Darius games, equates to being far larger than any other shmup on the market with stages reaching into the thousands. It's because of the game's mechanics. One might say it's easy to make a game where you move a ship and shoot at enemies moving on screen. Whether that is true or not, the real difficulty is making a shmup truly stand out from the pack, and that's a major reason I'm a fan of Darius in general is how the game flows as you progress, particularly the flow of the enemies (they're space fish with fish-like patterns). As per usual with Darius, you can select your own path in this game within the variety of game modes, and the difficulty rises about as appropriately as can be possible in a game such as this. It does become death-heavy somewhat often, but as with the other Darius games, it says a lot when I die and proceed to say, 'I love this game.'  As a huge fan of shmups and especially Darius, I purchased this one straight away and have been in awe ever since, and I've only scratched the surface in terms of content I've delved through. This is one of my very highest recommendations on all of Steam. If the price seems steep, I can assure you it isn't, though I'll understand if you wait for a sale. But even at full price this game is more than well worth the money.",
