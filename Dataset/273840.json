            "review_text": "tl,dr: SCE has tons of great content and compelling gameplay and is worth your time and money.  When I first saw Stock Car Extreme on Steam, I thought it seemed like something that wouldn’t interest me. “Stock Cars” mostly means NASCAR in the US, and I don’t like that kind of racing. And “Extreme”? Huh? It turns out the “Stock Car” comes from the Stock Car Brasil series which is similar to DTM. The “Extreme” is from Reiza’s (the developers) connection to “Cockpit Extreme Racing” which is a line of sim-racing cockpit products. I have forgiven the somewhat puzzling name.  After reading some reviews and watching some YouTube videos, I tried the demo found on Reiza’s website (actually based on the 2012 version) and it clicked with me right away, so I uninstalled it and bought the game.  SCE packs impressive content right there in the box. As of right now, there are 62 tracks included with the game. Most of these are located in South America or are historic versions of tracks from around the world. I think that is very cool. These are excellent circuits that are new to me, but aren’t contrived “fantasy” circuits. (Reiza knows how to make them look absolutely beautiful, too.)  For me personally, not seeing Spa, for example, is a little refreshing. I do really like that track, but seems that almost every racing game these days has the same core set of famous tracks while there is so much else to see. SCE supports tons of existing mods as well as SCE-specific mods, so you’re sure to find just about any track or car you like anyway.   Even though SCE is named after the Stock Car Brasil series, it offers many other classes of cars ranging from 1976 F1 cars to the Metalmoro prototype to Karts to 2014 F1 cars and more. Each class feels so different from the next that you are offered a very broad range of driving experiences.  Scroll up and look at the list of DLC. Hint: it isn’t there. Reiza is continually updating the game and providing new content for free. New tracks and cars just show up in the game updates. For free.  SCE has fantastic gameplay. Most sims these days have convincing vehicle physics and SCE is right up there with the best of them. • The engine, tires, and road sounds are all well done and sound great. Some of the metal-on-metal scraping sounds aren’t great, but everything else is really good. • The AI behave realistically and they make realistic mistakes, just like anyone. With the default and most appropriate aggression setting, they won’t crash into you like a dumb human, but will pass you when it’s proper to do so. • The force feedback effects are very good, but can be inadvertently ruined a little by the user if the controller settings are wrong outside of the game. There is a guide on the official Race Department forum for setting up your wheel. Once you have it set up properly, though, the FFB effects are as good as you’ll find anywhere. • There is a 24-hour cycle present in the game, so if you start an evening race (which looks fantastic), you may end up finishing in the dark. • The game modes are the usual simulation kinds of modes: there is Single Race, Testing, Championship, and of course Multiplayer. There are no “challenge” style events or modes. Just the kind of racing you might have in the real world.  The in-game options let you tweak all the things you’d expect, but if you dive into the various config files, you can really tweak everything to exactly what you want. For example, I have my track map going the full height of the monitor, but only within the leftmost 20% of the screen. I also have the sectors of the track on the map display in different colors. There are many in-game options you can change while in the garage, without having to go back to the main menu like some other titles.  SCE will likely work on whatever computer you happen to have. Because it utilizes the original rFactor engine (though you wouldn’t guess by looking), it is really light on system requirements. It’s almost guaranteed that anyone can get high framerates in SCE. It looks very good, but of course it doesn’t look as sugary-sweet-beautiful as Assetto Corsa or Project Cars, but sim racing is about more than just pretty pictures, isn’t it?  One drawback I could scratch up is that the interface in the menus looks dated and stretched by default. There is an easy to install mod (literally just replacing a folder) that makes the front-end much nicer and easier to navigate. Also, it really works best with a wheel. You don’t need an expensive force-feedback setup, but a wheel (even non-FFB) will give you a better experience than a gamepad. When I first got SCE, I tried my Xbox360 controller and a Saitek P990 and never really got the settings dialled in very well like you might have in a Codemasters game. The gamepads were just a little too twitchy, so I dug my 16-year-old Microsoft Sidewinder Wheel (non-FFB, 200-degree-rotation) out of the garage, and it was so good. I played SCE with that wheel for a couple of weeks before the game compelled me to buy my G27.  Stock Car Extreme is definitely worth buying whether you’re only interested in trying simulation racing or if you already have a collection of sim titles.",

            "review_text": "The first sim i bought for the pc was Race the WTCC game. which was about 4 or 5 years ago. I wasnt massively into sim racing then, it was just something i'd occasionally do, and i bought a cheap wheel and pedal set. Main reason i bought Race07 was coz i was into the BTCC and the WTCC in Race were the same cars (not exactly the same, but similar performance though some cars were in the BTCC that were the same such as the BMW 320 si).  A few years later i bought ETS2 and decided i wanted to play that properly with a proper good wheel so bought a G27, which was great. Not long before i bought this wheel i bought my second racing sim, Assetto Corsa but i was hardly playing it, mainly due to the steering rotation limit on the cheap wheel i had and i still wasnt into sim racing that much. It was the G27 that really got me into it then as i thought i'd try Race07 and AC with the new wheel and boy did i love it, the FFB and everything, felt great. So ever since i've been mostly just playing racing sims and went on to buy others such as GTR2, Raceroom Racing Experience, and iRacing which is subscription based.  One day i saw Stock Car Extreme, and by the sound of the name i thought it was some arcadey type play around game not worth a second look...but it was recommended to me in steam, so i gave it a look and saw so many positive reviews and i watched the videos and liked what i saw, couldnt believe it was a proper sim going by the name of it. So i ended up getting it and i can honestly say that despite the amount of different sims i have, i play this the most by far, in just offline racing as it is great. The physics, the FFB are spot on, despite the old graphics i've been loving it and i'm playing it the most despite paying a subscription for iRacing, along with the content on Raceroom. Now i said that touring cars such as the WTCC as what i like the most so i should really be playing Raceroom the most as that simulates them and has the official cars from 2013 (and now 2014) but theres just something about Stock Car Extreme that i love so much with just the physics and FFB and it has such a great range of different series including multiple types of karts and different eras of F1.  I so highly recommend this game and hope everyone makes a contribution to Reiza studios' recent crowdfunding campaign. They deserve it with making such a great sim and adding so much content for free which for games like iRacing and Raceroom would cost you, per car and track, so buy this game you wont be disappointed and make a contribution so Reiza can push it beyond extreme whilst they work on their new sim, which i'm drooling over the thought of! 10/10  The only negative which is a downer for me is the championship scoring isnt implemented correctly and seems to be bugged, but Reiza have said they'll rectify this, even though it has been a while now but hopefully soon they'll have a permanent fix for it.",

            "review_text": "I've been enjoying this game since 2012, long before the Steam re-release, and it ranks as one of my all-time favourite racing sims. It's a little known gem that deserves greater exposure than it has achieved to date.  Being based on a modified and evolved version of the rFactor engine gives Stock Car Extreme a great platform to build on and Reiza have done just that. For what it lacks in visual polish, Stock Car Extreme more than makes up for it on the track with cars that feel convincingly realistic. This is a title that really needs to be driven with a racing wheel to get the best experience, with force feedback that conveys the physics so well.  Car and track content is fresh, varied and eclectic with a South American focus (Reiza is a Brazilian developer) therefore offering something a little different from other race sims. The car selection ranges from the V8 touring cars that lend the title it's name to the Mini Challenge series to karts, a prototype, a Camaro and a selection of open wheel cars past and present. Tracks are equally varied with locations from around the world and historic layouts plus a couple of good street circuits.  In summary: Stock Car Extreme is a must-have title for racing simulation fans.",

            "review_text": "This is PC sim racing at its best. Praise the lord that is has finally been released on Steam so, hopefuly, wider audience may experience this brilliant game. It is not your average racing game, Reiza Studio has reached a point where you could experience how it might be behind a wheel of these cars. Force Feedback is so good that only sitting in a real car could be better and slightly outdated graphics don't matter at all when you start driving and experiencing the track through the wheel. Yes, the wheel. Sadly this game has to be experienced with a decent wheel with proper force feedback, otherwise you might be slightly disappointed with it. Some people might be disappointed by fairly limited choice of cars/tracks 'out of the box' but all you need to do, is to go to  RaceDepartment.com  and the whole new world of mods will open to you.  The sheer pleasure of driving that this game gives is just incredible and it is definately worth playing.  Pros: - The best FFB ever!!! - Demanding (real) physics. - South American tracks - Modding (incredible library of quality mods).   Cons: - Graphics (doesn't matter tbh) - Not too many cars 'out of the box' - Almost only South American Tracks 'out of the box'",

            "review_text": "This is one of my favorite sims. The physics leave little to be desired, the AI is fantastic, and the force feedback is the second best I have tried. Niels is a genius.. I play almost every sim on the market, but I was late to the party with this one, and i gotta say, I was missing a lot. The Reiza content is fantastic, and it also has a great mod community, with the best mods from RFactor available (only updated and upgraded), and original mod content as well. The physics and force feedback aren't quite at RFactor 2's level, but the content is possibly superior in range of vehicles you get. Nothing matches the best cars in RF2, but it also doesn't have any below average content, and every single car is worthy of your time. That said, after discovering RFACTOR 2, I have been spending a lot less time here. My only complaint is that the online community is lacking, but the fault lies on us consumers and not the game itself. If you haven't tried it yet, do it. Do IT! As soon as possible, do it! If you are into sim racing, I would say this is a must have title. Forget the other big names coming out right now, as they may be prettier, but none of them will give you the complete package and amazing wheel to wheel racing experience that this does. If I had to name one downside to this game, it would be the UI, as it can be a little confusing at first, and isn't as polished as some of the competition. . But that is a small price to pay for the second best sim on the market. And I haven't even mentioned the fact that Reiza is always updating, and releasing FREE new content to people who own it. There isn't a better value for your money out there. See you on the track!",

Has no addiction elements unlike Codemasters, there is no money, no arcade points and career But there TIRE WEAR, TIER TEMPS WHICH LOOK REALISTIC, FUEL consumption and perhaps only driving addictive here,  Nice menu, a step forward from both rFactors in my opinion, because I like how showroom is used here to select vehicle livery.  Great game, even when I played it on Keyboard, cornering felt to me like no other game, it's very dynamic, and if you do wrong thing at any point when passing corner(if you apply too much throttle or steer too much, or steer not smoothly), you can see how easily you can crash or get off track.  Graphics is nice to me.  Also I downloaded Lite edition some time ago which works for 30 days which is a lot to me, which is great, it has not much cars but still stock cars, formula reiza, carts are present, so fun for hours.  Also If you want to race lan, it should be nice for some serious sim racing competition between friends. (Sadly I don't have such). Maybe require Internet connection if you want to play lan - which is not very cool in some cases.  Basically it's a rFactor 1 + top quality content(very consistent, graphics, game menu and physics make this game look like game completely different from rFactor 1)  Focuses on brazil stock cars",

It's moddable, easy to play, and has great cars and series that come with the sim. The controls, handling, design, and artwork are fantastic. The force feedback is spot on and Reiza is one of the best developers in the business. They have never charged for DLC for this game and have given several cars and tracks free as part of updates. Short of not being able to create custom championships, there's not much missing nor are there many bugs. This is the game that Assetto Corsa and Project Cars wish they could grow up to be. The AI is the best on Steam and the single player portions of the game are fun and very time consuming. I normally play with a Logitech DFGT, but before I bought it, I played this game forever with an XBOX Controller. It works just as well as the wheel. This is well worth a purchase. As a matter of fact, buy this game now and leave Project Cars and Assetto Corsa on your wishlist for a whlie longer. If you tire of the in game content, there's a downloadable mod or track for just about any series or track thats out there. An amazing experience.",

These Brazilian tracks are really nice and fun and there are tons more well made track mods around too.  Setup was super easy for me, with FFB spot on without me having to change anything. ( I'm looking at you Project Cars). I did feel the need to change the cockpit movement, I didn't like the view learning but its easy to turn that off.  Ai is good, fast and fun to race with and the physics feel just right. The sound is superb, probably the best I'v heard in a race sim. It all adds up to a good feeling of immersion that I just don't get with some other newer sims.  And of course the superV8cars, Australian V8Supercars which with some mods can have Fords as well as the Holdens the cars are based on.  Hopefully/probably later we'll have lots more Aussie tracks and skin packs, as well as a full OZ V8 mod sooner or later..  There are some Cons,, Its looks a bit oldish.  Not rubbish, just oldish. Doesn't look bad at all but its no Project cars in the looks department.  Though this is a Pro too as it runs great on old hardware There is day, night and transition but I didn't find anywhere about weather and rain.  This sim has come along way since Game Stock Car 2013 with all the updates. If you are after a race Sim rather than a driving sim or a racing 'game',  then this is well worth looking into. .",
