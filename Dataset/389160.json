            "review_text": "I love runners. But definitely not this one. Unresponsive controls (mouse controls feels better somehow), lazy level design. Jump key often does not work, most of the obstacles are barely visible or not visible at all. Beat the game (50 levels) and didn't even feel that masochistic pleasure which often happens with such games. Also somehow lagging on a very good PC although almost not showing framerate drops in steam overlay. Also runs only in a window so technicaly support any monitor resolution but of course it's just a picture stretching. Very disappointing.",

I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.",
