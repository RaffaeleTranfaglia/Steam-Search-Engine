            "review_text": "Can I really slate a game that cost me only â‚¬3.99?!? Well, here I go...  I sort of feel sorry for the dev here as I've read a comment of his where he stated that a change in graphics/resolution would require a whole re-write of the game engine. Well, he'd better get started on that re-write because without a change in the tiny resolution, sprites and UI he is simply wasting his time putting any more effort into this game: it won't sell. Graphics generally are not that important to me, but this looks like something that should be played on an Amiga 500 in 1994 with the old Philips Monitor, not a modern PC, where 1080p monitors are the norm...but perhaps the dev is actually coding this on an Amiga 500 with the old Philips monitor in 1994!  In any case, the premise of the game is cool and I was digging the base building bit, which is reminiscent of the original UFO: Enemy Unknown base building mechanic: You build improvements in each square to provide resources for your guys etc...  The tactical part of it is pretty ropey with zero difficulty curve. Perhaps I need to send all my guys out on the first mission? Generally, I just send one as it's the first mission, simply a scavenging hunt and that should be a breeze, right? Wrong. My soldier dude is no match for two little spiders, he can't kill a frickin' baby deer and he gets cold, weak and downright lazy after about 2 turns. Also, there seems to be no escape except to fight once an enemy is on the same square as your little dude. Not very tactical, is it?  I want to like this game as I think there are some interesting ideas but it just comes off as too amateurish to warrant any more attention from me.  Dear Dev, get a free version of Unity and realise your ambition for this game. There is definitely a good game in here and I'm sure there is a market for it, but it needs to have proper resolution scaling and some game balance.",

            "review_text": "Link is a turn-based strategy game, that reminds me of XCOM: UFO Defense and XCOM: Terror from the Deep. Pros: Nice graphics You get to choose the three winning conditions (Ex: Surive 5, 15, 25 days, Kill a Ringleader, Kill five Ringleaders, Kill 10 enemies with melee, and more.) Gameplay is different each time  Cons: Can be a bit brutal until you figure it out Only plays in a tiny window (This can be fixed by pressing ALT-ENTER, but it will take a while to load the game/desktop.)  I rate 8/10",

            "review_text": "This game was a pleasent surprise for me. The game was alot more nuanced than alot of the people give it credit for. Now, I paid about a buck for this game, and it was very worth it. Is it worth $5? Eeh.... maybe?   This game plays as a series of short campaigns. You build, you manage resources and you send characters on tactical missions, but before long you either succeed or fail the campaign. If you succeed you get points to unlock new characters for the next campaign. It's unforgiving, but if you lose, you aren't losing much because the games are short. Either way, you notice things you could improve in your next game.  The tactical element is not immediately intuitive but is interesting. The stamina system lets you overexert your characters at the cost of future actions, and does it very smoothly. Mistakes here can get characters killed in a hurry. The system is complex without being cumbersome.   The base-building is surprisingly nuanced as well. You start off with practically nothing and there's a very sharp growth curve that you have to keep up with, or you get overwhelmed.   Rogue-likes this unforgiving are usually too stressful to be fun for me, but since the length is short it's much less frustrating than losing a run of, say, ToME or Don't Starve. It feels like a fun challenge, rather than a game that makes you scared to take risks. I think Desktop Dungeons is the only other game to really pull that off.   Not a huge amount of content, but definately worth a couple bucks. No bells and whistles on the presentation, but if you can see past the graphics the game itself is solid.",
