There are fewer things in this world as satisfying to me as building a system that can automate a task so I don't have to be directly involved once the system is running. Set it and forget it.  This game does that really well. After I get a production chain up and running, it just take infrequent checking to make sure it's still meeting the needs downstream.   The issue is, they don't keep running. In the current build of the game, the buildings (not just 1 specific one, but any and all of them) stop producing or stop delivering items. Output stops, so the chain breaks, and everything downstream that relies on that building stops working.   Up until I got to Tier 3, I was able to keep an eye on everything and keep deleting and readding the chains as they would break. With Tier 3, I have 4 islands running and I can't manage it. I've had to wipe and start over 3 times because it got so broken, buildings collapsed because their needs weren't being met, and there was nothing I could do to catch back up.  This is the only bug I've found, but it's game breaking. I can't continue to progress in the game while this bug is in the production build of the game.   That said, I will be monitoring DAILY for an update to come out so I can resume playing.   8/10",

The game's description tells you all you need to know what this game is about.. That is actually all there is to it. But the fun, challenge and execution in the gameplay is 100% solid!  There are 3 tutorials that each teach you how to plan, produce and make profit. Information is thrown at you, but takes you through everything piece by piece, then lets go of your hand briefly to make sure you understand how the mechanics work. As a result, you pick everything up quickly and will be ready to take on the game's few pre-loaded official scenarios. There is no question you'll get your money's worth with what's already in the game.  However, the real core content of this game will be in the Steam Workshop support. The game comes with a fully working scenario editor with all the tools required for the community to make scenarios to their heart's content. So with the great core game in place, this game's low asking price is a steal!  If this game had a point system from 'Stay Away!' to 'Buy it already, you Heathen!'.. This game is certainly the latter. You owe it to yourself to have this game in your Steam library!!",

One awesome feature I absolutely adore is that the buildings are very cheap, so it's easy to rebuild even complex layouts every time I change my mind.

You can't just build up your chain and forget about the supporting structure. It requires you to periodically revisit prior choices and rebuild sections of the economy. As you're learning the ropes, it's fantastic learning how to optimize sections of your supply chain. It could use some more difficult late-game levels and/or challenges that require you to more deeply optimize. There's room for this with the scenario editor and the community contributions to the Steam Workshop.",

I had one whole glitch pop up in a full playthrough and that was very minor (a tooltip wouldn't fade until I went back into the window and re-highlighted it).   It's a tight well thought through logistics game with very little visual clutter. It's all about the puzzle. I wholeheartedly recommend this game.

It doesn't have any overall theme (e.g. build a city, build a business), however production trees are not fixed (e.g. in one scenario researchers require apples, but in another they require meat) which means scenarios can create their own themes.  It has a steep learning curve and maybe its just me, but making your own blueprints (one of the main points of the game) seems too much effort when the default provided blueprint beats any of your attempts.",

First of all, if you dont like idle games. then just leave now and look for other games. But the rest of yall'. Just sit down and ima tell you about this addictin' game  Most Idle games, lack this feature. because waiting, Well... is just like waiting for something else. But this game, changes it all. By adding those annoying games Like clash of clans, that you have to wait 8 hours for your dragons to be trained. No, that brings people out of the game. I've played clash of clans 2-3 times, and ended up quitting it because I simply hate waiting. But this game makes buildings build instantly. Which I'd say, if your auctaully into those waiting games. Then you probrably just like it because you have like 10 hours of other things a day.  The game simply makes excellent gameplay by depleting the fact that you have to wait and come back in 12 hours. and also spicing it up by adding non idle/clicker game features. How do I put this? Blueprint Tycoon Simply spices the normal idle game that your used to playing  Grade: A-  Anything Other Then Gameplay:   The art... Well its definetly not worth 3-5 Bucks. So if your crazy as heck about art. Then never play an idle or clicker game again. We people go diffrently for games. Like Blueprint Tycoon lovers, they go for the gameplay. Not the graphics.  Grade: F+ (They get a bit of credit for the tiny pictures. but thats not enough)  The Guide... The art was very short because there was barely any except for a few shapes. Little pictures. And lots of text But the games guide. Teaches you by parts. And does very well on teaching you one way so you know how to do it loads of other ways. Its long. Like 2-4 Hours long. But its worth it.  Grade: A  Overall... the game is not good with art. Good with tutorial and teaching the player the basics of the game. I'd recommend this game to people that like the gameplay more then the graphics of the game  Overall Grade: B+ ",
