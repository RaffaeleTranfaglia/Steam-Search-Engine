            "review_text": "As a fan (and owner) of the original RBI Baseball from the Nintendo days, I am very pleased with this game. Has all the nostalgic nods to the old days and brings it to today. It feels and plays just like I remember it. Was able to just jump right in and get at it. Of course, there are quite a few improvements over the NES version of yester years with authentic MLB rosters and stats along with pretty good renders of the actual stadiums (that I have seen so far). Takes a bit of time to get use to the speed of the pitching and controlling your fielders, but I know this will be one I will enjoy as the season goes on.  Those of you looking for an experience like MLB The Show, keep moving. This is by no means a complete MLB simulation game. Graphics are smooth and purdy, but I care more for gameplay than I do how good it looks.  This was my first time playing any of the new RBI Baseball games that started in 2014, and I am happy with my purchase. Cant wait to get more in tune with the controlls and timing so that I may get my taste of online ranked matches.  In short, if you loved the original RBI Baseball on the NES, this will not dissapoint. PLAY BALL!!!! GO ASTROS!!!!",

            "review_text": "If you want people to keep playing the game and 'upping' their level in terms of starting from 'easy' then moving onto a more difficult level, then you may consider making the 'medium' level actually playable. 'Medium' plays more like a super difficult level simply because hitting the ball is like actually trying to hit a major league pitch coming at you at 100 mph. The 'easy' level is way too easy, especially when you can consistently score 15 plus runs every game with 25 hits and up. Just an fyi",

            "review_text": "Easily the worst Baseball game i have ever played... and I started playing Baseball video games on Gameboy. Even that was more fun. I see some people defend this as a arcarde-style game, but there is a major difference between good arcade Baseball games (like Super Mega Baseball) and this. The wodden animations, the poor visial quality (excecpt the menus, those look really awesome), the controls... every aspect is disappointing and seems poorly thoutout and implemented. Do yourself a favor: If you want realistic action oriented Baseball get a Ps4 and The Show, if you want to manage a Baseball team get OOTP, if you want an arcade style Baseball game: get Super Mega Baseball or play Genesis Baseball on an emulator. Don't support this lazy cash-in.",

            "review_text": "Growing up, I loved Ken Griffey Jr's Winning Run on SNES. I bought this expecting something similar. Not The Show or the 2K series, not OOTP, but an arcadey version of baseball to scratch the itch without putting in too much effort. I didn't want perfection, the occasional bug would've been fine.  For the most part I got what I was expecting, but I quickly found a game ruining bug where both myself and the AI could hit NOTHING but foul balls. Hitting a ball in play was no longer possible. We would both smack foul ball after foul ball until a walk or a missed swing for a strikeout (which was rare). Every at-bat turned into a 20+ pitch at-bat. It didn't matter that my pitcher was exhausted (200+ pitches), the AI was just going to hit fouls no matter what. I restarted the game, it went okay for several innings until the bug reappeared. Unfortunately I didn't realize that the refund policy was for less than 2 hours played. I own over 70 games on Steam, never regretted a purchase, never asked for a refund. This game broke that streak for me.  I am very disappointed that the MLB would endorse and advertise for this game. I don't think any of them actually played it for more than an hour. No arcade baseball game for PC is better than having this game.",
