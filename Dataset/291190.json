            "review_text": "A turn-based party RPG from one of the most active Developers on steam. Full respect for the time and effort the Trese brothers put into their games. Personally I ran into a very minor issue with the game, the dev responded instantly and a patch was out the following day. What more could I ask for? That shows a lot of passion and dedication to their product. Constant patches/improvements, always active on the forums and actually talking to their players.   The combat system is solid with 8 different characters to choose from to make your party of 4. The story and characters are well written and interesting including their interactions between each other.  A range of weapons, armour and other equipment can either be looted or purchased from merchants including the ever necessary consumables. Skill/talent and stat points as you level, and easy respecing. Personally I quite enjoy the art style in the game and zooming in the combat map the character models still look good. I've been having a lot more fun with this game then I expected, it's definitaly worth it's asking price. I'm looking forward to sinking a lot more time into this over the weekend.  Trese brothers are ones to watch, truly passionate game creation wizards. This game and Templar Battleforce have won my loyalty. Side note it is really worth checking out Templar Battleforce as well :)",

            "review_text": "Excellent Turn based squad game.  Pros: Good story Great character development Engaging missions and story Wont hold your hand abillities and stats that all matter 8 unique characters of which you can choose 4 can group all characters together and move as far as you want on map...unless you encounter baddies! outstanding pathfinding Good ambience and music although you may want to turn music down as combat music is a bit loud. Different difficulty settings  Cons can't build your own character  Final verdict: if your looking for a good turn based squad fantasy game look no more. I have several and this is my favorite so far. The graphics my not be stellar but they are charming and yhe idle animations make the characters look alive. The game is very intuitive and easy to learn. For those looking a fun old school style tbs rpg you found it 9/10 ",

            "review_text": "Seems like a good game so far (about 2 hours in). The artwork is great, and the story is pretty good in an old-school RPG way. Combat is also good, and very similar in style to many tactical combat games. The UI could use some work...in particular, tooltips when hovering the mouse over things like talents would help a lot. The on-screen keyboard when naming your group should clearly go away since PCs have keyboards (unless it thinks I have a Steam/XBox controller?). It would be great if you could sync progress between the PC version and the mobile version (Steam Cloud for Android in the future maybe?). Overall, it's fun if you like tactical combat games and old-school RPGs. The devs are great and very responsive from what I've seen. I'm looking forward to playing more and seeing what the future holds. The devs have a long history of making lots of updates to their Android titles, so I expect this game will get better over time on both Android and PC.",

This is one of the best developers around. This game is a superb fantasy tactical RPG. It has a lot of character and still continues to get updates regularly. Do not let the graphics fool you into believeing it is a subpar game. You need to play it to really find the beauty in its design and story. The UI might take a little getting used to and for me it was too, but having the hot keys actually makes this an easier experience on PC over the original Android versions.   You will not be disappointed by giving this game (or any of the Trese Brothers games) a try. You need to experience them to believe. They also have superb forums and communicate with their fans daily.  Oh and be sure to try out the Iron man Ladders.",

            "review_text": "Just getting started playing this on my Mac -- I've been playing on my iPad since Episode 1. Game is definitely faster with keyboard shortcuts and I really enjoy hearing the music from real speakers instead of the iPad internal ones.  The artwork has a hand-drawn almost comic book style which some people may not like, but personally I don't mind it. A game doesn't have to have perfect graphics if the mechanics, balance and pacing are good -- and for me, this game hits all three of those.  Each of the four character slots has two options, each with different styles. I purchased all of the add-ons for my iPad and was VERY happy to see they were all automatically included and available on Steam. The replayability of the game comes from two things for me -- the different character builds (the Barbarian can be a Tank or a carry, depending on how you build him) and the plot options.  The first time I played through the game, I didn't realize how many of the choices would have impacts in later episodes. Think carefully about which side you want to support, if you support the warlord's rebellion, and which family is telling the truth.  My advice would be to build your fighting characters around one or two major talents, and focus on raising them to at least level 5. For Vraes I think his Savage Strike is better than Crushing Bash. If you use the archer, make sure you raise Aimed Shot and the 'critical hit' buff.",

The UI is lovely, being able to contract your party into one person and boom, ready to fight? split!  There are 8 character classes in total with their own personalities that move the story along. But what I care about is the gameplay, which is nice and simple. It reminds me of Spiderweb games, but with the devleopers own twist.   If you're looking for a classic topdown RPG with some modernity to it, you can't go wrong with this game. :)",
