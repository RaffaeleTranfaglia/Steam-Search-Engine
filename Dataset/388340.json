            "review_text": "This is actually a funner game than I thought it would be. Here's a list of pros and cons!  Pros: -Simple and Fun game -Good level structure -A bit of challenge  Cons: -Some of the white blocks blend in with the back ground which makes it hard to see where to land or go. -Some of the parts of some levels take a longer time and get quite frustrating.  Other wise, this is a cheap and a fun game. Definitely worth your 50¢!  -Note to author  Congrats on your first game! It's great to see that a simple game like this that actually fun. I'd rather play this than some very buggy and broken game. Keep up with your good work!",

            "review_text": "This game has one BIG ISSUE.  The blending of colors and not being opposites. I am colorblind, and I was consistently confused with the textures in the game. This resulted in many deaths.  Not only that, but the terrible music which just loops every 30 seconds is very dull. Mute the game and listen to some YouTube video featuring any of Beethoven's music and you'll get the same thing.  Lastly, the platforming and gameplay is very dull. I found the gravity to be very uncomfortable.",

            "review_text": "For a first time development project, this isn't bad. But at the risk of sounding like a jerk, I don't think it's good enough to sell, even at such a low price. Based on the Steam page I had been expecting a very basic platformer, but I was also hoping for a quirky sense of humour, some kind of story, an interesting gimmick or two, or at least some kind of art design to justify the title and to brighten up the blocks we're jumping over. There is some fun here - it's a good start and I look forward to what comes next - but I dont recommend this one. It feels very bare bones, more like a practice assignment than a finished product.  Pros- Addictive 'rage game' quality. Some fun level design.  Cons- Not very precise in its control or hitboxes, no story or style, backgrounds are mostly just coloured shapes, music is a collection of MIDI versions of classical tunes, no sound effects at all and very few animations (death for example is just an instant reset).",
