The devs have announced that the game is coming to consoles and will be updated a little leading up to the console launch. So yeah more updates and bug fixes should be great even though I personally haven't ran into any bugs that I can recall. If you like twin-stick roguelite shooters with fun upgrades and consumables then you should definitely check out Blacksea Odyssey, there's even a nice demo to wet your beak with.   Now go get your white space whale! :)",

            "review_text": "When you first enter this game you might think that it is too corny, the character you are given somehwhat of a Space-Age 'Ahab' who even is out to hunt 'the great white one' just with a lost arm instead of a lost leg and cheesy banter between the contestants before choosing the monster to hun. However the moment you are dropped into your first match (hopefully after learning the few ropes you need to know) you embark into a randomly generated stretch of space and go out to hunt your target and see where this game really shines:  Every enemy of the game has weakspots you can tear and rip, most of which are giving it either an attack to hurt you with or which are essential for moving around. As you begin your first hunt you get to feel the first satisfactory rip and tear of an enemy's body while learing to maneuver the board you are 'surfing' on. Once you have fished away all the 'smaller' enemies (or if you feel lucky go straight ahead to kill the boss) you end up meeting the prey you chose only to face a creature that might as well hunt you down instead. The bosses with their elaborate behavior patterns, massive size and tons of HP are the bread and butter of this game and it is a blast to 'hunt' them down. They whack you away like the fly you are forcing you to learn their patterns, evade projectiles and melee attacks while whittling away at often elusive and protected weakspots to tear them off to do more damage. This essence of studying your target and strategical approach makes for tons of fun with hours on end! Even if you bested the same boss over and over again you come back and the 'worst' you could say is 'Oh, hello old friend. Is it this time of the tournament again?'  As for controls the game is smooth and swift, the harpooning and spear-throwing going on without issues while requiring your skill to make the most of them. You HAVE items you can use, but one-use items are to aid in a pinch and are never able to one-hit anyone but lesser cannonfodder. They are all about strategic use which you have to time, less the item is wasted or even worse...you! Several spears (not harpoons!) to choose from give you another tactical element to consider which often goes hand-in-hand with the 'runes' you find. They are passive bonuses which are divided into the 'Spear' and 'Ship' group which augment and enhance the respective aspect in many ways. Do you want some poison damage to slowly chip away at the bosses health since you cannot hit him? Do you want higher chances to throw more spears for bursts of Extra-DPS or are you so cocky to use a rune massively boosting your damage while you stand still? The options can be mixed and matched on the spot thanks to a generous inventory size so you can adjust to match every enemy with a tactc befitting him and while there are pattens it is you who sets the pace and approach every time.  To summarize, Blacksea Odyssey is a game about real 'big-game' huntin in space with options to improve your weapon and ship while challenging you to take on more and more dangerous creatures with 4 different Contestants (3 Unlockable) to choose from and over a dozen harpoons. The closest equivalent would be a Monster Hunter meets Top Down Shooter in Space, although the customization here is not as massive. Taking bosses apart in a literal manner is fun and requires skill which keeps you coming even for bosses you already ended before to see how much better you have become. Fighting them is adrenaline inducing as you are likely fighting for 5 minutes per boss depending how well you do and things never get dull either. I have yet to notice a bug that affected gameplay and it runs smooth without issue and I clearly recommend this for anyone liking themselves some top-down action against big bosses round for round and a handful of RPG-inspired enhancements. Each run is new and yet not, old 'friends' and new challenges surfacing every new try. Now get out there Contestant and hunt your way to the top in the depths of the Blacksea Odyssey.",

Totally worth it for me personally, the gameplay can reach such intensity that it would be quite fitting to call it 'Radical'. Give the demo a shot, thats the best way for you to figure out if its a game for you.",

            "review_text": "I played with an XBox360 gamepad. The game does NOT have 'Full controller support'!     Gamepad thumbsticks have no deadzone     Not every Menu is controllable with the gamepad (e.g. shop window, level finish screen), or is simply behaving weirdly (level selection map)     havn't seen that the gamepad is reconfigureable and I'm not happy with the thumbstick button boost     when I try to fly into the opposite direction as the char is currently watching, the char flies a small half circle. This is especially annoying when standing still and trying to avoid a bullet, in which case the char does fly into the bundle most of the time. I would like to see the char to rotate first and then accelerate not both at the same time.     some enemies move so fast, it's literally not possible to hit them with the harpune.     idle and fight music is not faded into each other but switches instantanous, wich sometimes leads to fast music switching (every 5 secs or so)   I would have enjoyed the game if the gamepad control was better. Tight now I don't recommend the game, sry, but since it's my fault that I overlooked the Demo-Button (most games don't have a demo these days..) I still give a thumb up ;)",
