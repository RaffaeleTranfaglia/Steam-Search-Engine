            "review_text": "Gosh, growning up and getting my first 286 machine with a mathco and discovering the plethora of adventure games from Sierra On-line (then just Sierra), oh my old 2400 baud modem, my Game Blaster, oh and my CAD digitizer (I know I am geeking out here), but all of it made playing games like this so much fun and challenge. Save often friends, you may live or you may die, but at least you can retry ;). Gold Rush had to be one of the most entertaining games I played, I was a history buff and getting to somewhat live it in this game made it a true blast, and that is only part of the fun. You also had to figure out what to say and how to say it correctly to get items, or get the correct information, or not die from scurvy going around the cape! Everyone shoudl play this if nothing but for the history of adventure games. Thank you for reading!",
