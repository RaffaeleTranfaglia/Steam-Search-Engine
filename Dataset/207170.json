            "review_text": "Legend of Grimrock is a certain game of twenty years ago, dressed in modern clothes. The recipe for this turned out to be surprisingly simple - leave completely untouched form the core of the game, using new technology only where it is necessary.  Legend of Grimrock has almost no plot. Yes, somewhere in the background, we have a story of four convicts who were thrown into perdition to inhabited by monsters and traps bristling labyrinth of dungeons. Throughout accompany us also to be found in various places notes made ​​by a man named Tooruma, who wandered through the corridors and halls before us. At each level during sleep appear 'visions' with a few sentences. And that's basically all the elements of the story.   Interestingly, it was one of the first elements so characteristic of the classic games of this type. At a time when the 'stimulus feature films' are limited to a minimum, begins to work the imagination. With scraps of information, in an atmosphere of understatement, alone, almost automatically, we are trying to fill these gaps with our own conjectures. It builds sometimes much more evocative atmosphere than most told, 'film' story.   The gameplay is based on three pillars: exploration, solving puzzles and fighting.  We move through the corridors and rooms in a classic style. Levels are divided into square segments. One press of the button allows traffic to pass a single field or a reversal in the direction of 90º.  By far the biggest asset Legend of Grimrock are puzzles. At each of the thirteen levels we will get at least a few of them. Sometimes, their accumulation can be intimidating. All puzzles rely on the use of several of the same components. We have a mandatory collapse, levers, plates react to the pressure, the buttons in the walls, or portals. An absolute masterpiece of ingenuity is their use.  Although there are not too many types of enemies, they are diverse and properly assigned, so only at the end of the game started to be missing 'something new'. I like the fact that most of them require the use of appropriate tactics. Additionally, this old-fashioned and a bit clunky combat system perfectly conceals imperfections SI, which knows only two tactics: to follow and the encirclement. Moreover, developers have used these qualities even several times in riddles.   I must commend graphic design, but here also I have a few objections. It's basically the only 'modern' element of Legend of Grimrock but it is used quite well. Textures, dynamic lighting, models of opponents and their animations look great.  Legend of Grimrock is a damn successful - I would say that close to perfection - back to the already-forgotten genre. Thought even the most hardcore enthusiasts oldschool and implemented the option to disable the automatic drawing of the map. For players remember the 'good old days' and exchanging hand-trended on a piece of checkered maps, is a wonderful gift.",

            "review_text": "This game is great for two reasons: 1 - This is just a VERY good old-school dungeon crawler with high difficulty level, difficult puzzles and many, many secrets. 2 - This game showed other developers that true old-school game still may be the best seller. Almost Human Games - thank you for that.  VERDICT: If you're a fan of modern cRPG and want to see how all of that had started, you should play it. If you're a fan of Dungeon Master or Eye of The Beholder, I'm sure you already finished this and you know how good that is.  Like this review?

            "review_text": "Now this is a real dungeon crawl. Getting past traps, monsters and locked doors to the stairs is the whole game. Story, Cut scenes and character motivation are all minimal. Heck the textures, loot and sound effects are minimal too. Some may be bothered by that, But I wasn't.   I couldn't resist 'old school mode', Break out the graph paper and DIY, Even for the first time out. Doing so, Mapping became the central focus of the game. The ambiance of the dungeon also became more pronounced as you don't want to get caught with a pencil in your hand and not a sword. I've played the old Wizardry and Bard's Tales and have always enjoyed the act of mapping. And I enjoyed it here as well.  Combat is real-time. So click on your weapon to attack or click on your hands to ready a spell, then select the rune pattern of the spell and then cast the spell. That's a lot to do for a mage, But then again, Casting spells should be more involved than swinging a sword. Turn-based would have been more “old school”, But may have lessened the importance of the ambiance as a result. The “Prepare, Attack, Move, Repeat” pattern is acceptable.  I found less than 50 secrets. I didn't try that hard as such things have never been a strong motivator for me in-and-of themselves. Getting through the dungeon had some tough spots. The worst of which was having to redraw a badly drawn map followed by some investigation/experimentation. The best of which was being thrown in a room full of nasties with my escape route closed off. Only option...run deeper into the dungeon. But you don't have time to map when your frantically running away.   For my party I decided to go sub-optimal and let a RNG choose my races, classes, initial attribute point allocations, traits (I did select a couple of racial traits myself) and pictures. I got 2 Minotaurs (A fighter and a mage) and 2 Insectoids (Both mages). Happily they all made it out alive. I'd be interested in taking another group of random criminals into the mountain.",

            "review_text": "Wow.  This is a WOW game.  This game doesn't have cutting edge graphics, the audio is slightly better than average, and the genre is as old as, what, the 1980s?  This game isn't great because of some stupid parlor trick. It's good because it's a near-perfect implementation of a specific class of game; the old PC dungeon crawler.  If you love finding secret wall switches, solving puzzles and finding loot, and eating a giant roasted maggot-on-a-stick because you're desperate to eat, then this is the game for you.  If you want a fantasy FPS with lots of jumping and airducking, this isn't for you, GTFO.  Legend of Grimrock doesn't try and improve much on the old classic dungeon crawler game design, I think that works well for it, and I don't think they do anything really new or crazy that hasn't been done in dungeon crawlers before. They just put modern graphics and sound together into a game and implemented it well.  The game doesn't have any music beyond the title screen, but the ambient background through the game is pleasant and detailed. Turn the volume up, because sounds of the dungeon will alert you to nearby foul beasts and secrets.  The background story is compelling and interesting, but nothing too deep. Secrets are found in the dungeon, and a reason for being is evident, but they leave the details up to your imagination, which is probably for the best. You can't climb back up. Your only way out is down. The story is your journey along the way.  The last few levels are spooky and the game has a very fulfilling final battle.  Secrets are plentiful, so pay attention. There were a couple of puzzles which had me really baffled, including two that were required to proceed with the story. I don't recomend ruining the challenge for yourself by reading a walkthrough online, but if you get stuck in the story, it's there for you. The best thing to do is sit and think. With two specific exceptions that I can mention, most of the puzzles are evident if you just use your brain for more than thirty seconds.  I do have a complaint regarding the final puzzle in the game (Minor spoiler warning): There are four items which need to be placed around a single block in a room. Two of them are pretty easy to figure out, but the small gear in particular has a non-obvious arbitrary placement location which should be fixed. Even if you have the right item on the right wall, you have to click it on a very specific small area that doesn't offer any clue that it's the right part to go in the right place.  Also, the level 9 riddle room had me really stuck for awhile. I just didn't get the clues and had to randomly guess at it until I figured it out.",

            "review_text": "This is definitely an old school style dungeon crawler RPG and I can say that because I was actually gaming back in the 80s. The visuals were nice as well as the sound and music, but the game could be brutally difficult at times. I usually pride myself on not using guides and walkthroughs to solve puzzles in games, but this game caused me to have to do that a few times. I felt like some of the puzzles required you to make such large leaps of deduction that I found myself at times just trying random things, or trying different patterns until I got lucky and opened the door or found the secret. Also, the combat system could be a little off-putting and didn't fit with the theme of the game. Would four party members really do square dancing in a dungeon with an ogre? I beat the game and the story was OK, but even though I try to be a completist, I still left many secrets, treasure, and weapons unfound as I traversed all the levels of the game. Overall, I liked it but I will probably never play it again. It just got to grindy towards the end and I just wanted it to be over.",

            "review_text": "Legend of Grimrock is a great example of an indie game that finds a niche that bigger devs and publishers have no interest in and does it well. It takes the gameplay of old dungeon crawlers like Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder and puts a nice coat of paint on them. It's surprising how well the idea holds up with only a few little quality of life improvements.  Of course, Grimrock isn't for everybody. Most people are probably going to find it a little tedious to slog through same looking hallways while having to save scum in case a monster closet opens up on them.The tile based movement and 'click on a character portrait' combat is less than smooth, but if you're the kind of person who likes Resident Evil with tank controls than you probably understand how restrictive design can be a good thing sometimes. It creates a frantic combat atmosphere as you try to coordinate moving around with attacking while setting up rune combinations to cast spells.  For a certain kind of person, there's something engrossing about wandering lonely, abandonded hallways, solving puzzles and finding secret treasures. There's no soundtrack here, just the moan of an empty dungeon and the occasional skittering of an enemy that might be safely locked away or just around the corner waiting to pop out at you. There are no loot drops, if you want better weapons and armor you better make sure your puzzle solving is up to snuff as everything needs to be earned and a lot of things are squirreled away pretty deviously. Generally the game is pretty fair and you can get through with a minimum number of secrets found (I discovered a little over half) one puzzle that required backtracking for specific items that you might not think important to carry was annoying, but most puzzles that you need to solve to progress won't make you tear your hair out.  If you're interested it may be better to jump to Grimrock II, which I've heard improves a lot on the formula here, but on its own this is still a solid game and a unique experience if you're not familiar with this style of game.",

This is a lovely homage to the old school grid based dungeon crawler genre, easy enough to learn so the younger generation of gamers can enjoy it, but truly challenging enough what older gamers would expect. Well balanced, fun, proper achievements and hours of gameplay with an affordable price tag. Highly recommended for anyone who love single player adventure and rpg-games in fantasy style.  Be aware though that if you never had played any grid based dungeon crawler games before, the controls will probably feel a little awkward for the first minutes, but just learn how to move properly and soon you will be dancing around the enemies :)  (Sorry for any grammar errors, English is not my native language)",

            "review_text": "This game follows in the footsteps of games like Eye of the Beholder, yet gets lost along the way.  Mainly this game is trying to take an RPG and make it a strategy/ puzzle crawler, instead of a dungeon crawler. In order to succeed at this game you can't fight monsters toe to toe. The game seems to be designed in a way that you must exploit the game mechanics (taking a swing at a monster then retreating before it can attack) in order to survive. This combined with constant puzzles instead of exploring, make this game a poor choice for anyone looking for a true RPG dungeon crawler game.  Party creation is also mediocre, with a minimum selection of classes, and non dynamic races. You also only get a 4 person party instead of 6 which also limits experience.  The game also has a combat interface that is clunkier than I remember the Eye of the Beholder games to be. You can equip two weapons on a chanracter, but can't use them at the same time. Also the spell system tried to be inovative with a rune selection process to make spell casting more of a challenge in the heat of battle. However, the spell interface needs to be opened each time and has some issues.  Also food seems to be unevenly distributed in the dungeons, making me wonder if food was initially and after thought of the game, and then made into a major mechanic at the last minute. It seems to be laid out that if you try and 'clean' the dungeon by exploring every inch of a level, your party will starve to death. However since the game is based on puzzles to unlock the next dungeon, complete exploration is usually a must.",

You control 4 characters, 2 in the front row and 2 in the back, and explore a huge dungeon full of monsters and puzzles. Its VERY similar to the first Eye of the Beholder, but with a better interface and an automap feature (that can be disabled, if you feel like it).  The graphics are great, the enemies are varied and the challenge is quite high. And the puzzles... Ahh, those can range from 'I had to think a little' to 'WHAT THE HELL DO I DO HERE?!?!'. And believe-me: they are FUN, and give a feeling of accomplishment when you finally solve them. The sound effects are great, with realistic ambient effects that give a nice scary mood to the dungeon crawling. The only issue I have is that the game doesn't have music. But thats not a BIG issue (EoB also didn't have music. ;) ).   Anyway, this is one amazing game. Can be frustrating if you don't like puzzles too much, and the battle system can become repetitive after a few hours. But hey, its an amazing game that can take more than 20 hours to beat, and you can even download usermade dungeons to make the playtime even longer.  This game is very recommended. ^^",

Either I made all the wrong choices either your party is always at a (more than slight) disadvantage as you get to higher levels. I've been poisoned and eaten alive by spiders, incinerated by those flying armored mages, and even chewed up by frosty lizards. The devs really want you to suffer in this dungeon that often seems like a dead end as it's almost impossible to fight and defeat more than one enemy at the time. All the fighting is done real time but there are no shortcuts or hotkeys, therefore the computer will always be quicker then you as you will struggle to command the attack with your mouse - especially with the spells that need several inputs : choosing the wand, choosing 1-4 runes, and then pressing on the attack button AGAIN! But most of all the puzzles will drive you crazy: 'The Maze of Madness' will drive you as mad as hell until you can't take it anymore (or find the improbable solution with no hints whatsoever) and the mostly random logic will leave your characters and yourself starving while you bang your head against the wall.   The minimalistic nature of the game is classy, but the lack of real meaning to many of the puzzles is frustrating; some are genuinely good and easy to understand thanks to a scroll (the shadow maze for instance), but now I'm currently stuck in an endless hall in level 9. There's probably a hint I'm missing somewhere in the slaughterfest but maybe I'll die before I find it. I might never see the light of day, after all I've been there for over 24h already...Grimrock don't roll, it's a total headbanger!  PS: I eventually found the scroll and got to the game's over-the-top goofy conclusion; you have to see it to believe it! Also the level editor is great and relatively easy to use and some of the mods are actuallly way more enjoyable than the original, there's this awesome Mine of Malan Vael and The Tower of Bones that could both easily be official DLCs while we are all waiting for the sequel.",

But to me, it was mostly the gameplay that I really liked about this one. I really loved fighting in this game. It started so slow. I wasn't even sure I was liking it at first, but after an hour or so. Bam. I was in. I was in it for good. Nothing else really interested me. All I wanted was to level up, gain abilities, gear my characters, kill more stuff, walk further, discover more secrets, and of course get confused by the puzzles.  Grimrock is a perfect example of a typical indie game that takes an old 90's (even maybe late 80's) gameplay design and redo it in our modern era. It is kind of a slow game. Every time you move is tile by tile and when you attack or so you click on the attack, do it on front of you, wait for the cooldown and repeat. But in the end, it's only like if it would be a turn based combat system, but sometimes, you can get a turn faster than your opponent. Also, it gets pretty hard. You can facetank the first level or 2 but the gameplay gets pretty crazy pretty fast. You discover new types of weapons and new monsters. You have to kite them in order to survive. They are hard. You have to act fast and think fast too. You are not always fighting in the same environment. It's a really great mechanic. Any limitations you may have, the monsters have them too. You have to learn their pattern, and execute yours.  There is just so much stuff to discover. The whole world is begging you to find the hidden stuff everywhere. You will have to face really hard puzzles just to keep going on the main tract. They always comes with clues, so it's really fair. But some of them are really obnoxious and if you are not in it for the puzzles, you might want to consider looking for a guide. Or maybe just relax and take notes for an hour or two because some of the puzzles really require you to do so.  It might be a good idea to look for character guides too before starting to play. The way you build and play your character really matters. Like you might completely ruin your run if you put stats in stuff you end up not using. The game gets pretty hard later. You have to have good gear and especially specialized characters. So if you consider playing, but you only have time for 1 playthrough. Do a bit of research, look out recommendations, and get the game because it is really fun to play.  I give it 8/10. I can't wait to play the second one !",

No dialog pretending to be grey.  This is pure RPG gameplay. You create your party and fight through a dungeon of monsters finding new equipment and leveling up their skills and stats as you go along.  Despite the fairly oldschool grid based gameplay it is a pretty game, with good sounds, great exploration, hard to find secrets and frustrating puzzles. The combat might seem simple from the outside but movement will play a major part in the harder battles and particularly on the harder difficulties.  If there was something bad to say about this game it was a relatively short main campaign but the addition of Steam Workshop fixed that.  A great buy.",

Near the end it took me literally minutes to take down one enemy, even though I had some proper spells and weapons. There are moments where you will be overwhelmed by quite a few enemies. Remember to save often, and try not to lose any of your party members before you reached the end of a level. I had to finish a level with just one rogue and it took me 3-4x longer than it should've. The game can be finished in about 10-12 hours (in-game time) but in reality it should take you about twice as long.  You will die several times, and some puzzles require thinking, experimenting or just plain luck.  But despite the difficulty, I did have a great time with it !  [Rating: 82/100]",

            "review_text": "This is how a dungeon crawler is done. It's really old school with lots of modern elements.  So, what's the story? Well, there sort of isn't a story, ok, yes, there is, but it's not so essential to the main plot. The plot is that three people accused of crimes are thrown into a dunegon and must escape. So they must survive while there are monsters everywhere, disgusting food, a strange dream that happens sometimes when you rest, creepy sounds and amazing atmosphere. The graphics add so much to the atmosphere too because they look very amazing and somehow this game runs very well on my terrible PC. I wish more games did that.  There are 3 main parts to this game and I will review each aspect one by one:  Combat  Puzzle Solving  Exploration  Combat-The combat in this game is an old school style one, you're party is in 4 people all linked together and you walk on square tiles. You have to gather up weapons from monsters, hidden rooms and exploring the place as so. The magic combat system and the magic system in general is you have to combine a certain combination of runes. You can find these combinations on scrolls which you find and by leveling up the certain types of skills in the game. Speaking of the skills, the skills are pretty much subclasses in classes. The 3 classes in this game are fighter, rouge and mage. (There's a fourth one too but you will have to discover that for yourself) Each class has different abilities, attributes, purposes, uses, etc. There's also traits you can have on each character. There's lots to choose from and some races have their own trait. The 4 races are Human, Minotaur, Lizardman and Insectoid. Each are good for their own class, like how the Lizardman makes a good rogue and how the minotaur makes a good fighter.  Puzzle solving-The puzzles in this game are diffucult. I had a LONG time trying to solve them. But after solving all of them, it was all worth it since it was fun and rewarding.  Exploration-Without exploration, I don't think this game would've been so great. There are TONS of secrets everywhere. Some are easy to find, some take forever to find. For all those loot lovers out there, you will love this game because of all the loot and what it takes to get it. To go into a little more depth of exploration is the moving system, to turn you can't just turn all the way around, to do that, you would have to turn sideways and look sideways again since you look always in a 90 degree angle.  To conclude, I would love to say Legend of Grimrock is a great modern day game and I would recommend it to anyone.",

            "review_text": "Not since Portal have I played a puzzle game that made me feel both stupid and empowered when I figured out the answer was right in front of my face. Legend of Grimrock combines an old-school dungeon crawler mixed with puzzles and RPG elements.   Synopsis: You control a group of 4 prisoners trying to escape Grimrock by solving puzzles and fighting monsters. Puzzles can be as simple as a hidden button on a wall or as complex that things may take time and patience to solve.  Gameplay: The best way I can describe this game is if you mixed D&amp;D and Myst, with tons of aggravation. The Legend of Grimrock isn’t as one dimensional as the art style and movement may lead you to believe. Many of the puzzles will leave you scratching your head and swearing there isn’t a solution. The other aspect of the game which I believe could use some work is the battle system. As intricate as the puzzles can be, the system to fight monsters throughout gets repetitive and leaves a lot to be desired. It’s a mix between real time and turn based, with a focus on the formation of your team. If your characters use all short range abilities, you have to swap one of the two, for the one you want to attack. Many monsters can be defeated without much strategy and sometimes become a hindrance to trying to solve a puzzle. There are four classes you can choose from as you customize your perfect party, but very little direction or tutorial on how to use each class. I found myself having to look up a guide on how to use a mage to even understand what magic could be used. I have logged thirty-eight hours on this title (some of it was afk during a multiplayer game), but at less than $5, 20 hours of engrossing gameplay and a strong community following, this game is more than worth it.  Positive:  +Challenging puzzles are intricate enough to make you feel clever +Game can be saved at any point. +Large community following where content can be downloaded.  Negative -Battle system can get repetitive. -Not all classes are created equal.   Art Style/Graphics: Think old school, first person, dungeon crawler. This game is a great blend of classic nostalgia with a jolt of current 3d graphics. Much of the game in spent in the darkness with two to three walls around you, but this doesn’t mean the creators were lazy. Attention is paid to simple cracks in the wall, to how the light bounces off each wall. To speak more about the lighting; this plays a huge role on the tone of the gameplay. The torches on the walls (or the ones you drop on the ground) limit vision to what can be around the next turn, which makes you feel like you are actually there.  Positive: +Lighting is engaging. +Can be played on lower-end computers. +Can be played in Windowed Mode  Negative: -Characters and enemies could be upgraded.  Soundtrack/Sound effects: This was one of the biggest negatives to the game for me. For the 20 hours I played, much of the time was spent trying to solve puzzles. To solve puzzles you have to explore the dungeon, often falling to lower parts. Hearing my characters yell as they were falling, over and over, got very annoying. This is only increased by the often reused sounds of the characters attacking and grunting in every fight they encounter. On a positive note, the minor sounds of metal doors closing, walls moving, or crackling of the fire, add a realistic aspect and can be heard in surround sound.  Positive: +Simple sounds of environment   Negative: -Repetitive   Cost: I personally bought this game in a Humble Bundle (only paying $5), but that being said, I would wait for this game to go on sale. $14 (full price) is a bit too much for the amount of gameplay in the standalone. At 75% off ($3.75) a case can be made. This does not include the amount of community related additions on the workshop; which is extensive Positive:  +HUGE community created content  Negative: -Full price not worth standalone ",

This game is great--if you're a fan of oldschool dungeon crawler games, I highly suggest you look into the Legend of Grimrock series.  A few notes: -This game is fairly easy to add content to, such as extra player portraits -Does not lag, seems to run pretty well on most machines -You can choose to fill in the map as you go, classic style -Doesn't have turn based gameplay, but rather each character has a cooldown on their weapons -Spell system is intrigueing and somewhat reminiscent of magicka -Straightforward gameplay -Challenging without being unnecessarily difficult -Graphics are okay, not top of the class but still decent  If you like puzzles or dungeon crawlers, you'll like this game.

Great dungeon crawler with a good story and RPG elements. Fun and interesting levels to explore that are fortunately not so complicated that you'd need graph paper for mapping. The only thing I didn't like was that to defeat enemies past a certain point you often have to sort of strafe and attack to kill them - I don't mind fighting like that in a more action game, but for a game like this, that mechanic felt a little out of place. Still, a great game for an old school type dungeon crawler RPG. Highly recommended.",

            "review_text": "I remember the first RPG I played on my very own first gaming system. The 8-bit NES. It was a dugeon crawler.  The name was Swords &amp; Serpents. It was a difficult one. With four different characters struggling through the mazes with only a few things in my mind. To level up, to find better equipment, to search for traps and secrets.  Constantly threatened by wandering monsters, stronger every floor, and pay attention to traps and secrets every step you make for just that one bottle of potion extra, a few gold coins or that very nice piece of armor. Altough the genre was not so popular that moment but I enjoyed it a lot.  I remember myself sitting in front of my big old TV with pen and paper to write down passwords en to map the maze.   Many, many times the the devs try to make a RPG or dungeon crawler type of games to enjoy fighting monsters, hunting for treasure while exploring the dungeons. I enjoyed the Might and Magic series, but always after a few hours playing I can’t stand the graphics of that game. I think the game what reminds me most of my first experience was Wizardry 8.  The graphics where great the moment from release (now still acceptable) and it was huge, with a lot of items, spells and exploring.  When I saw the first screenshots of Legend of Grimrock I was hoping that this was a real modern version of my first experience. But I was skeptical. The graphics on the screenshots looked too good to be true. I thought that because of this beautiful graphics for sure the gameplay itself isn’t that good. I was disappointed a lot with modern versions of old games lately.  With the SummerSales for I gave it a shot and after a few hours playing I’m blown away! It looks beautiful indeed.  Even on my 3 year old laptop. The graphics are so polished and so smooth. I really like the style.  Also stones are real stones with different width and height. That’s cool. No flat textures anymore.  The lighting is fabulous. And the mouse freelook is very comfortable to inspect the first time you enter a room.  That the rest of the movement is not free movement is only a good thing. It’s easy concentrate on the environment when walking around and you have time enough to inspect walls for loose stones to find secrets.   I found A very balanced set of items for my first party in my first dungeon.  If you want to reach the end you also need to use all your items carefully. Don’t throw away a little stone, take that +1 old armor and that shoes in the corner of the room. It can make the difference between more down one dungeon level or a single trip to hell.  The monster movement is realistic and they look really good. The fighting is also very innovative, fast but fair. Just prepare yourself and click on the right time on your weapons to use them. It’s a little bit real-time and a little bit turn based. A good combination to keep you excited, but no need to be a master in keyboard combinations. The interface is totally friendly and slick.  You can see the makers of this game are real interested in the genre and in my opinion deliver a great game for hardcore RPG, exploring, dungeon crawler, magic, fantasy, dungeons and dragons fans. But also a game what is very easy to learn, but hard to master, for the casual or newcoming gamers.  What maybe for some people is one reason to consider is I didn't see too much of storytelling.  Do not expect pages of information about things happens around you and history about the world you play in.  There is not. For me that is not an issue. What you can expect is small notes with important information or text written on the walls.   Even in the start of the game you have the possibility to not automap the game so you can go back to the good old days to make your own map! But it's optional.  The character building as well isn't very complicated. It's the most basic skills and stats what you can have in game.  But they are all there and it's very clear to see directly what effect the numbers have on different skills and stats.  What is really make this game oustanding is the complexity of carefully exploring the level where you are in. Every move count, every choice of action you make count and for every single item it counts how, who and when you use it.  That is gaming!  I hope this game is give you the same great experience what I had with my first game in this genre. ",

If you had played Knightmare, or anything similar, then you will appreciate LoGrimrock - If you haven't, then this would be a nice change of pace for those who are tired of the same old RPG or MMORPG styles.  Admittedly, it didn't take me long to complete the full game, though you have a secret mode to enjoy (assuming you found a specific secret) - As well as a heck of a lot of other hidden secrets to find, which can easily be missed on the first few playthroughs.  In short, this game was a nostalgic reminder of a style long past, and a fresh experience for those who hadn't played such games before. It's a satisfying dungeon romp that will have you side-stepping spells, arrows, traps and monsters until the goo-cows come home.",
