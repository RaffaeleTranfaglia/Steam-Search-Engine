            "review_text": "5.5/10 - Short Mediocre Horror/Suspense Point and Click!  This game is pretty average but I can appreciate that the creators didn't try to do too much. They stuck within their wheelhouse and made a short but decent game. This point and click offers a more realistic horror element than most. The characters are fully voiced and well done. The notes however are complete garbage; tiny scribble writing I stopped even trying to read. I completed the game in just shy of 2 hours; due to the quality, plot and length $10 is quite steep for this one!  You play as a woman who narrowly escapes a sinking ship and manages to find herself aboard another abandoned vessel. You and a new companion begin to investigate the ship, looking for the captain and crew. As you explore the true nature and story of the vessel come to life! Will you and your companion finally find salvation?   Worth $2-3; not bad, but I'd look for 75% off to truly enjoy this!      Accidently Reviewed",

            "review_text": "Black Sails is a Creepy and Mysterious Point &amp; Click Adventure Game from the German Developer Deck 13. It's a story about 2 passengers who end up on a Ghost Ship. Like any Adventure Game, you search for items or clues in order to escape from the ship alive. If you like Adventure Games, this will be a very good addition to your collection. To maximize the game experience, turn down the lights and put on the headphones. The graphics and voice acting are great, but not always perfect. The puzzles are not too difficult until you get near the end. I suggest you save the game, think about it, then go back and play the game.  There are only a few problems with the game as I see it. The game is too short; you could probably finish it in a day. The other problem was that the game seems to crash often. Just Save the game often and you'll be OK. I see where someone commented about the voice acting, remember this is a Germain game. What you see is the characters speaking German, and what you you hear is English. I bought this game on sale for $4.99 and I'm quite happy with it, I got my money's worth out of it, so I am recommending this game for True Adventure Fans.",

The admittedly intriguing story is told through really bad voice acting (at least in the English version), and it all leads to an ending with no closure whatsoever.  As a life-long fan of point-and-click adventure games, I cannot recommend this one.",
