Perhaps my experiences are colored by a long lifetime of loving this game, but I have never found something that interests me more, that I can just sit down and play a few hours of and craft a life-story for my character, an entire persona. It's simple really, you are a pirate and the wide open world of the 1600's Carribean is yours for the plucking. The graphics are out of date, the controls are simplistic, and your crew will always get upset no matter how many famous pirates and ships you sink, steal, or scuttle. You can't win, mainly because there is no victory condition. You can save your family, you can get married, you can become the deadliest and most notorious man on the high seas, it's all up to you what you do, who you become, which beach you get marooned on, I love it, I've lived years loving it, I can't recommend this game enough. It isn't for hardcore gamers, don't come in looking to get the highest score, play to relax, it'll work, you'll love it, just, just play the damn game.",

So it gets a 9 for the sword fighting mechanic, naval battle (obviously trivial to the latest AC title), and the excellent portrayal of a pirate's life without the STI.",

The only iffy part is that the game is mostly controlled by the numpad keys, which is weird at first, but you get used to it as you go on.  The only part of the game itself that's also awkward, is the dancing segments you have to do to woo a Govenor's daughter. I would say definantly pick this up if you're itching to play a good pirate game that's been hard to find, and/or you're whetting your appetite for when Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag comes out in a few days.  Seriously, go grab this right now, it's cheap as hell and worth the $10 (or rather the $3 I paid).",

The only thing that bothered me a little was the dialogues. It is just subtitles. No voice-acting at all.  Voice-acting does not matter when you are playing a game with such wonderful gameplay. You can choose to follow the storyline of    finding your kidnapped family members    or play like I do, sail the high seas, sinking other ships, taking down notorious pirates and attacking settlements.  This game is very nearly perfect and my favourite game of all-time. 9.5/10",

            "review_text": "This is a fun, casual game. It is not, by any means, deep, but it's still enjoyable to mess around with. You play the game as a pirate in the Caribbean pre-Johnny Depp. You can play the game during various historical settings which basically have the effect of changing how much variety there is in terms of the different national factions. The later you set the game, the more likely you'll see major French, Dutch, and English ports. By contrast, in the earlier settings, it's far more Spanish-dominated.   This can have an effect on how you play the game. With more factions, you have more ability to behave like a true pirate, sinking or taking vessels of various factions, and then doing the same to whomever they're at war with (and they're always at war with someone...). When it's just the Spanish, you have to try playing a minigame where you sneak into the Spanish port, risking imprisonment. Speaking of the minigames, they're generally good fun, if occasionally repetitive and annoying. The dancing in particular can get tedious, but at least you're usually well rewarded.   As I mentioned, the game isn't particularly deep. It's not as if you're running a wooden ship simulator. The game's graphics are dated, but acceptable. They were fortunately done in a 'cartoony' style, so they age a bit better than supposedly cutting-edge visuals from the same era (2004), which now fall squarely into 'uncanny valley' territory.   Anyway, it's a good game, and usually available on Steam for dirt cheap. You'll definitely get your $2-5 worth out of this title.",

This ended up in my library a few days back and I had to play it again. The nostalgia is strong in this one.   This is one I revisit from time to time and EVERY TIME I do I get sucked in like it's my first time playing it. I have played and solved a lot of games (like, A LOT of games), but this one seems to be one I can revisit. The vague maps, the different mini games, the overall joy of just being a pirate and blowing the hell out of ships is just as fun today as it was when I played it years ago.  Pirates, it's been a blast. See you in a few years when I dust you off again. Don't change!",

            "review_text": "An entertaining and highly addictive pirate simulator. You won't believe how much fun it is.  Most of the game is played in a top-down mode where you control a ship that can travel between ports buying and selling goods and engage in naval combat with other ships. Wind speed and direction play a role, but you can generally travel into the wind without the need for tacking. Your ship has up to three weapons which target the enemy ship's hull, crew, and sails. There are about 10ish ship upgrades, which you can buy at specific ports. You can capture extra ships and build a fleet, but you only ever control the flagship and the remaining ships just add extra crew and cargo.  The rest of the game consists of a number of minigames and dialog trees.  - There is a sword fighting minigame that plays like a very basic fighting game. You mainly play this against enemy captains to capture their ships.  - There is a dancing minigame where you must react to a sequence of quicktime events in order to win the hearts of maidens. This is not much fun and is the worst part of this otherwise excellent game.  - There is a buried treasure minigame where you walk about on land looking for buried treasure.  You need to divvy up your loot with your crew periodically, at which point you lose your fleet and most of your gold and crew. You'll advance via the items you acquire and your quest progression, but much of the rest of your possessions will come and go over the course of the game.  There is a plot about rescuing your kidnapped family, but this isn't really a story-driven game. Most of the actual gameplay is about capturing ships and searching for treasure.  Yaar!

You are a pirate sailing the Caribbean. You sail, sword fight, capture ships, woo maidens, and dig up buried treasure; all while trying to locate and save your long lost family. No two game plays are alike, and I've never encountered another pirate game quite like this one... Lord knows I tried.  Because I am 6, my Pirate is the notorious captain Tite Hassole. Captain Hassole is a proud duke in the Spanish armada, until it suits him. He then raided the city Margarita about 3 times and turned it into the Dutch Port of Margarita, because reasons. Tite was also a bit of a player and while he would beat a hasty retreat from any plain governor’s daughter, at least 6 times, Tite Hassole gave all the crew's money away to get a ring for a lovely lady or two.   A constant issue for me is the repetitiveness of the sword fighting, and to top it off I'm not that great at it. It becomes essential to know how to sword fight well, especially in the late game, but I never got over my 'smash slash really quick' routine.  All in all a solid game, well worth the money and real nostalgia trip for me.",

I used to spend hours playing this game on the venerable Commodore 64, then on the Amiga, and again on the old 486..  First up, I will confess that I prefer the original, especially the Amiga and PC versions, but I still enjoy having a lash at this now and then. I actually bought this game when it was released, but the disc has since succumbed to bit rot, so when I saw this on sale the other day I had to buy it.  The addition of extra subgames adds to the fun and there are many other small improvements such as being able to battle multiple ships at a time. The audio and the visuals suit the game well and the addition of cut scenes enhance the games charm.  While it may be nostalgia that draws me to this game, I still heartily recomend it. I also recomend that people try out  Pirates! Gold Plus  (comes with the original 1987 game and the early 90's remake) so they can get a taste of what made the game such a classic, and why Sid Meier has long been considered a legend.  4/5",

This one, however, is still just as awesome now as it was when I first played it.  I have played a lot of pirate sim games over the years, and this one, to me, is by far the best. There is so much to do and so many ways to play - it offers a ton of replayability. It has all the ship combat, treasure hunting, town raiding, dark alley sneaking, and ugly daughter avoiding thrills I remember and they are just as fun as ever!  A very easy to learn and use interface lets you get right into it and start buckling all the swashes you can handle! I really can't recommend the game enough, especially if it is on sale (for $2.50 USD at the time of this review). In terms of a game you can play for a few minutes when you're bored or spend a day with those swashes we just talked about, you can count on Sid Meiers Pirates! being there for you!  ",

You decide whether to join crew with the Spanish, the Dutch, the French, or the English. Either way, you later mutiny against your captain with nearly the rest of the crew. After defeating the captain, the crew elects you captain. You are then allowed to do whatever you wish.   Be that fighting for a certain nationality, being a Pirate and attacking everything in sight, raiding towns, attacking merchant ships, trying to rescue your long lost family, defeating the 9 best pirates in the game (Blackbeard, Henry Morgan, Stede Bonnet ETC) or just doing whatever you feel like doing.

Clean as a captain's spyglass is the play of the ships and friendly enough fer' lads and lasses of all ages ta' enjoy. Ye be starting with a measly sloop and the entire Carribean be at yer' call. Chase after ye lost family or sack some french ports and marry the Governer's daughter. Pirates be as timeless as the sea herself, an' for just 10 pieces of eight, she be right for the remembering. Yar.  Horrible attempts at pirate talk aside, this is by far one of the best games I've ever enjoyed playing. I can remember back when Sid Meier's Pirates had just been released how many endless days were spent sitting in front of my computer screen playing the wars between England and Spain. It's got a special place in my heart.  The game plays out as an open-world sandbox where one is free to pursue the noble goals of taking down the top ten most notorious pirates of the carribean and sacking ports. Or if one is feeling a bit less like fighting they can play the relatively simple merchant game of buying goods in one port and sailing them to another for profit. There is the ever present staple of pirate tales where buried treasure maps can be found. Also this portion of the game around your entire family being kidnapped and you needing to rescue them, there's that. However Pirates never directly forces you to do anything. It is a sandbox in the truest sense, at least under all of that water. Ships can be upgraded at the different ports and while learning the map comes naturally you won't be stuck going to the same 4 ports over and over (Unless you choose to, that is.)  The combat element plays out in one of four ways. The naval battles between ship and ship feel crisp and polished even despite the game's age. While rudimentery in some ways, ships bombard eachother with broadsides of roundshot, grapeshot, or chainshot. Once enough damage has been dealt or if taking the ship is the goal the ramming of the two ships together will start the swordplay. Swordplay consists of three attacks, three dodges, and one taunt. While basic it is entirely about timing and plays out fairly well. There is a turn-based strategy portion to sacking a port with a landing party but my strategy in this has always been to simply bring more men. The only place where the game falls short is in it's Stealth selection of sneaking into a hostile port. It's not bad, but it does feel a bit slow and very repetitive.  Out of all the games I've played or purchased on steam through either my own library or familyshare, this one is by far the best Game-Per-Cash value. At $9.99 it's nice to see a familiar old face pop back up and give me hours of good natured fun. I can't reccomend it enough.",

Years ago an evil pirate breaks up your family leaving you alone and now you're matured you set out on the Caribbean. From there you choose to follow the storyline of getting your family back OR disregard that and lead the life of a stereotypical pirate.  Gameplay is a little limited BUT there's a lot of paths you can go. By paths I mean you can choose which time period to live in, choose what life you want to lead, choose whom you ally with (or be a total pirate), a great selection of ships (all customizeable), your personal skill sets. The limited part is that for most of the time you'll be doing the same thing: get a ship, go plunder other ships, sell items, get gold, talk to people in the town. There's some side things like rescuing people, helping a country out, collecting treasure maps but generally it's the same thing regardless of which path you go.  The visuals are very colourful and beautiful. Although the game is old the visuals have a style that still looks good and not dated. The sound is great. The music, although limited to a few key tunes, is very pirate styled and pleasing.  So in short although the game is somewhat limited in what you can do it doesn't get boring over time!

Meanwhile, AI ships will dance circles around you  - The winds tend to blow extremely fast in one direction (west in my experience) making travel in the opposite direction very tedious and time-consuming.  PROS:  - Immersive, the general atmosphere is great  - The music is simple but lovely  - Fun, when the difficulty is balanced [usually never] (even at lower difficulties it's an imbalanced game)  All in all I can't say I enjoyed my time with this title.

Basically what would happen is that when the wind blew a certain direction, any fabric on screen would stretch to infinity and obscure 60-70% of the screen. The next issue I had was that for some reason the primary method of control (awkwardly using the number pad) straight up did not work. I tried a different keyboard as well as an old PS2 board and neither allowed any of the diagonal buttons to register.  I’m not a computer genius or anything, but I can’t imagine all the technical problems I had running the game being anything more than driver issues and modern operating system changes.

At around ten dollars, this kept me entertained, relaxed, and engaged for most of a weekend. It is well worth the cost. Many developers now are pushing for a more real-life experience with darker visuals and more deeply challenging game play, but I don't want to play those types of games all the time. There's still plenty of room left on the SSD for brighter, happier visuals and simpler, joyful games.

Spain: Huge amounts of land and ships, but the ships suck and the land cities are heavily guarded. Ships are usually huge, but slow, and have a huge amount of crew, but the ships seem like they are made out of cardboard. Has most cities in the game. Also, the Spanish are at war with everyone almost all the time.  England: Sloops and Brigs as far as the eye can see! England has some of the fastest ships, and remember how I said the Spanish ships are made of cardboard? Well, the English cannons fire the equivalent of napalm in a ball when hitting a Spanish ship. Besides the Spanish, they have the most amount of cities, although most are islands and not on the mainland Americas.  France: The French have some what I'd consider all around style of ships. They are a mix of ships and power, but they work. They have less than the English, but aren't doing the worst.  Netherlands/Dutch: 'Oh sweet almighty Jesus, we are screwed,' is probably what you'd think if you were the Dutch king. Basically, the Dutch aren't exactly doing the best when it comes to amount of land or types of ships, but it's much easier to buy and sell in Dutch markets, as well as get promotions. Basically, you want more recruits and buy food cheaper? You want to be Dutch.  Jesuit Missions: Basically, think of a bunch of priests living on islands. There you go. They have no real alignment or ships, they just are there and sell food. Talk to them to help with your main quest to find your family.  Pirate settlements: Like a regular city, but you can usually only get recruits and food here, but you can end up helping the pirate leader to take over cities.  You do NOT have to side with anyone. Basically, the game allows you to have the freedom of you choosing the options to help anyone. I, personally, help the Dutch all the time (because it's actually easy if you are good with economic type of gameplay), but you could, for example, help the Dutch one time, help the English one time, help the Spanish once, then help the French, and have everyone love you.

A ran into a bug that spawned my fleet on shore and it was stuck there, overwriting both autosaves so I could no longer continue.  Sid Meier's Pirates! becomes repetitive quickly in a sense you know it didn't really have to. What I mean is, all the mechanics of the game are awesome ideas, but are lacking volume.   For instance, the amount of ships in the game is very light. You will easily get the best ship and be disappointed quickly by this. I mean, this is fine, but the amount of content they could easily add to a sequel makes my head spin and can't figure out why they have not.  There are no good pirate games out there, IMO, that offer the arcade play style that Sid Meier's Pirates does. The game is simple and satisfying.  ---  If they ever made a sequel, this would be my fantasy features  *way more ships *diplomatic relations more diverse *being able to create your own faction/nation *rampart(nes) city attacking and defending mechanics with modern twist *multiplayer - lot's more but I have to run",

            "review_text": "I enjoy this game from time to time. It's a slow paced pirate game - achingly slow when it comes to sailing (there are ways to speed it up, but even when maxed speed it's achingly slow when you sail against the wind) where you basically sack towns, fight and collect ships and more or less do what you'd expect in a game based on pirates.  The ship combat I like the most. It's all about nailing the enemy ship(s) hard enough to cripple their ability to fight back without doing so much damage that you sink them (lest you say goodbye to the loot on their ship - or the ship itself if you wanted to capture it for your fleet) all while taking into account angles and wind direction to keep your ship moving.   There are a good number of ships but once fully upgraded they fall into 2 basic catagories:  1. Big ship. Holds a lot of health, crew and cannons. 2. Small ship. Dodges everything much easier with small size, fast turning, and fast speed.  Once you collide of course there's a boarding sword fight scene - the ship battle being to widdle each others' crew down before boarding or get the other to surrender. The more crew you have the more time you have - if one crew defeats the other before the sword fight you're in is over the winning crew takes the win. There are a couple of options for swords but they don't change the experience very drastically unless on higher difficulties. After the fight the winner takes the loser's ship (they'll either sink it or add it to their fleet).  There's a few other things to the game too. Sailing and ship battles tend to take up almost all of the time I spend playing. The battles are not soul draining though - unless one ship runs and the similar speeds result in the chase going on about a literal minute or two of almost no stimulation (I prefered small fast ships because they cut out the speed problem more often than big ones). There are a few other parts though. Minigames as part of the game progression more or less; ballroom dancing with govenors' daughters to raise reputation with them, sword fighting resembles a combinarion of 'Paper-Rock-Scissors' and Flash Cards, hide and seek style treasure hunting where you collect map peices and use them to find where to go, and city seiges which feel like turn based Overhead strategy game.  The overhead city attack is actually a little fun too. Your crew make up 3 unit types. Officers, Pirates and Buckaneers. They play very simply. Officers and pirates melee attack like chess peices that all only move 1 space each on the board (with officers being stronger). The buckeneers can shoot from several spaces away for much weaker damage. Attacking from the back or sides deals a lot more. Diving into cover helps against their guns. Also the more one unit gets into a fight the weaker he is due to moral dropping. That's about it to the strategy. There are no buildings to create or making more units or anything. The enemy does have a pretty varied amount of unit types though (protip: If the enemy has horsemen go straight for a forest tile. Those suckers are OP outside of them but get cut a third of their strength in forests. If the enemy has indians get out of the forests).  You pretty much do these things over and over. There's really no plot or story other than a little intro scene (well technically you hunt down family, but it's not very focused on). It's a reletively fun game when just chilling and wanting to pimp up a ship. I won't lie though... the slow parts are painful.",

Attack and plunder ships from different nations, only use care not to continously attack the same nation vessels/cities, otherwise they will attack you on sight for some time. If you get in good with the local mayor, you can begin courting his daughter based on a game of pressing the keys in time with her dance movement. This dancing is similar to combat in the game, only with the combat, you want to press the key that counters the pirates attack, not the same attack. Also, if you court the daughter enough times, you can eventually marry her. There are three levels of 'hotness' for each daughter. You should be able to tell which daughter of a town/city is the hottest and which one is mediocre (the amount of cleveage is a good indicator [except for one version of the Dutch daughter, you just have to look at her face and breast size to verify if she is the hot one or not]).  When you obtain enough portions to complete a map, you can search the land for buried treasure or a missing family member. You can also assault a town/city like this, switching to a strategy game of moving your troops around a grid.  One problem I had with this game is the pirates you recruit for your ship. They constantly become demanding for more and more goods. If you hold on to the goods for too long, sailing from one location to another without constantly plundering goods, they may mutiny on you and take off with one of your ships. This usually requires splitting up the loot and recruiting more sailors, which eats up time in the game and lets your character age more quickly. The second, and much worse problem, in the game is the game becomes too redundant. You go to a port town, sell off your goods, recruit new sailors, plunder ships, and search for your missing family and buried treasure. At first it is fun but does lose its appeal about half way through.  I still enjoyed this game overall and would recommend playing it, especially if you can purchase the game with a Steam special sale price.",

I wanted to experience the game again, (My CD-ROM version of the game is lost to time.) so I searched for it on the Steam store. I was plesantly surprised when I found one of my childhood relics in the results. Gleefully I bought it. I booted the game, chose my name and the nation that I would steal my first ship from, and set sail. I am happy to say that this game has weathered the test of time very well and still holds a depth and replayability that many more modern games lack. Even ignoring my nostalgic feelings for the game, I feel compelled to recommend this game to everyone.",

Quite a good and funny game but definitely not what you expect from a modern game any longer. The game was released in 1987 and kinda overhauled and re-released sometimes around 2004. Considering the age of even the later version graphics and game look pretty good. I bought it for about 4 bucks which is an ok price, but I would never have paid 10+ for it. This game is not a simulation, it's more an arcarde style action game where you sail around, sink ships of several factions or pirates, do some politics and a little trading and can go for treasure hunting as well. actually the game has all a good pirate game needs. Yet, the action becomes stale pretty fast. Trading is kind of tedious as it requires you to have large ships and go long distances. Sailing long distances is punished in the game as your crew is going to desert you faster than you can replace them. In the later game this seems to get much better, but getting there is not funny at all. You can use your small starting loop to easily take a full blown war galley as prize. But you will not have the men to maintain it for long, even if you have loads of gold. The game is pretty open to your actions, there is no fix chain of quests you have to follow, although there are very helpful quests. The information in the game and the presentation of your ships is bad. You do get zero info about the capacities of your ships (you can carry 60 guns in small ships, but you don't see easily how many guns get fired and how many are just cargo). There is no full size view of your ship in the menues (I wish I could have seen it in full size and rotating), no fluff info (ship type, tonnage, sails, guns, etc). Hunting pirates was a laugh, I brought down No. 1 from the list within my very first 15 minutes if gameplay. Orientation is hard sometimes when leaving harbour, the compass is pretty simple and yous camera view very narrow. Although many seem to have enjoyed the cartoonist fun style of the game I missed the feeling of grim and dangerous piracy. It feels a bit like playing pirate in your bath tub. Good for a moment but nothing that makes me remember it or want to proceed further. Nice but yesterday.",
