My play through went flawless during the two hours i played.  No glitches or half-done stuff just pure eye and ear-candy from the first colors till the end. I warmly reccomand this game if you want a break from the regular noisy comers games.   Big thanx to Moondrop",

            "review_text": "Amphora is a short, but exceedingly beautiful puzzle-game. I bought it solely for its visual design, though the gameplay and overarching story were fitting, welcome additions.  The game operates in a series of interactive, scenes that follow the life events of the nameless female protagonist. In these scenes, you complete anywhere from one to several actions to trigger an event. I had a bit of trouble figuring out the solutions to a few scenes, but overall the puzzle portions are pretty simple. And I say simple, not boring. Later solutions can take a bit of thinking though, a bit of ruminating on what exactly you're trying to do, and what kinds of options you have available to you (you gain a few different skills as the scenes progress). Of course, there's always the 'try it and see' approach, but I think most things are better solved by careful observance. There are also multiple ways to complete the scenes.  Overall, the gameplay was fun, and sometimes challenging, but the best part of this game is the stunning visual design. The sound design is also light, but effective.",

The first couple puzzles show you the mechanics of the game, but once you get those down they get increasingly harder. Some of the puzzles definetly posed a challenge, especially the second to last! It is a short game, you will probably complete it in a couple hours or so. However, it is definetly worth a replay. Everything about the game was great, the storyline, visuals, music, ect. Would Recommend.",
