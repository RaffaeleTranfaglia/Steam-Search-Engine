The unfortunate part is that this game is VERY BUGGY, and has crashed on me more times than I can count, in the &lt;45 minutes that I've tried to play it. I've given up on even being able to play this anymore. Save yourself the money and skip this one.",

            "review_text": "This one was a lame time killer. Basically, you combine two things, and ONLY two things to create new things. The logic of the combos is crap. It is likely the creator thought some of the combos were funny, so that makes one person. You end up just cycling through every combo to unlock more stuff to combine. For the little time I played the game, I can't help but feel that I came out a little dumber. You can get more entertainment, sense of accomplishment, and challenge by breaking out the pumice stone and sanding down the calluses on your feet.",

I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for something to keep you occupied for more than an hour or if you're looking for a good adventure, but it's an alright game. I remember playing it when it was free on those old flash game sites, that's really the only reason I bought it. Also the only reason I'm writing this review is because every few combinations they keep PROMPTING ME TO WRITE ONE AND THEY WON'T STOP. so gr8.",

I'm having fun with it. It is definiteley a casual game though!",

These hints you get from time to time eventually (and free), you get them as daily rewards (also free) and you can win them in multi-player (also free). Not to mention that you can simply google the Doodle God Wiki and use it to complete the game without any hints. And of course you can actually THINK and complete the game yourself. So, why are these people SO mad? Maybe because they are SO dumb and cannot play puzzle game without hints, which they actually bought? Nobody forces you to buy anything, the game can be freely completed without any additional payments.  Apart from that - its a nice puzzle game with good and sometimes hillarious gameplay. I strongly recommend it to all puzzle-lovers. Cheers.",
