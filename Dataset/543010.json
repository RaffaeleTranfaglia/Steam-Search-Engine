    "description": "Aggressive hockey is back! Experience hockey the way it was meant to be played in this old school arcade style hockey game where blood on the ice is just another day at the rink. Big moustaches, no helmets, dirty hits, bench-clearing brawls, goalie fights, and stick fights – that’s Bush Hockey League.",
