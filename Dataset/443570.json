The game is full of bugs, in the few minutes I've played I had too restart the screen several times, because the character just kept running and didn't react in any way anymore. As far as I have played, there are no real puzzles/you can't really decide how to interact etc., the game tells you where to go and that's that. Perhaps this will change later on, but I don't want to play until these horrbile bugs are fixed. It's no fun, when the character keeps turning in the wrong direction, jumps, when it should run and vice versa and the situations when it just doesn't stop running!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
