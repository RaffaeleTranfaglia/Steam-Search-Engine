            "review_text": "Let me start by saying this: I would normally NOT recommend this game to people. I'm kind of weird in the fact that buggy games don't bother me too much, and I have a lot of patience for unfinished games or games with unrealized potential. I also have to restart the game every few hours if I'm doing a long play session because of memory leaks, and I have 24 Gigs of RAM. This game's a technical nightmare, and isn't receiving support from the publisher anymore. The developer still exists, but is hanging on by a thread.  I recommend, if you're even interested in this game, to check out the first game. It is easier to learn, and very stable. It would be awesome to see this game finished, but it won't happen anytime soon, if at all.  I think one of the biggest tragedies of this game is simply the lore and the story. This game has no campaign, only custom scenarios, like most other 4x games. The game includes what's called a Sotspedia that's more in depth about things than other comparitve things like Mass Effect's codex. The lore behind the major factions/races is inredibly deep. In fact, I own a book that takes place in this universe.  This is also evident in how each faction/race has not just their own strengths and weaknesses, but they have completely different methods of FTL travel, which has a huge impact on the gameplay. Things from the Tarka's standard warp drive, the Hiver's gate network for instant teleportation once they slowboat it to new systems and set up a gate, to the Liir's stutterwarp drives, using thousands of teleportations a second to move, increasing in speed the further away from gravity wells they get. They're all pretty interesting. And there's 7 of these factions.  But, again, I cannot recommend this game unless you're hardcore into this genre, and want to find what is, perhaps, both a hidden, yet flawed and tarnished gem. I love this game so much, but I cannot just tell people to check it out. I want them to consider this game, while informed.  If you're at all interested, I recommend checking out the wiki. It has a lot of helpful and interesting information.",

            "review_text": "The other reviews of this game are quite old by now. The game has updated plenty since release, fixing many of the bugs and performance issues other reviewers were having.  While not the same as the original Sword of the Stars, SotS 2 is a great 4x game. It adds a great amount of complexity and diversity to the already diverse SotS formula. The fleet command interface is strange compared to the original SotS but once you get used to it it is quite reasonable.   The only problem I have with this game (besides some minor interface quirks) is the AI. As other people have complained, the AI has a tendency to just camp around its homeworlds for the entire game. But this, however, does not mean that the AI will be sedantary. The AI will send you fleets composed of a dozen different designs, making the tech to see the loadouts of enemy ships completely useless, because the AI never ♥♥♥♥in' sticks to any one design.",

With all that said, once you learn the interface and how the fleet system works it can still be an enjoyable experience.

I didn't get the game then, because of all the reported bugs, and because I had no cash.  But about a year after it was published, I had a bit of money, and I thought the game was ready, so Ibought it. While steam says I've spent about 55 hours playing this game so far, because I have been without internet for a good portion of the time I have owned the game, I probably have put more like two or three hundred hours in.  If you like the 4X genre of grand strategy games, or turned based strategy games with real-time tactics in general, I think that this game is the one for you. It's got lots of complex mechanics that allow for an interesting, irrepeatible gameplay experience.  My main gripe about this game, compared to its predecessor, is the tech tree. I think that the study feasiblity mechanic was not the best way to make the tree semi-random. Also, the effect of some techs seem to be a bit questionable, whether or not they actually do anything.  But on the whole, I would recommend this for anyone who has played Sword of the Stars Prime, or anyone who enjoys this genre of games.",

Like with any game and game upgrade, it's a learning process. SOTS II is a much more involved and complex game than it's predesesor, SOTS I. Still, I am learning the operation and control of the game as I go along.  A few things I need to mention, the pluses. Of course, a lot better graphics goes a long way. I also like the variety of settings that it comes with. The ship design function is great, at least to me. The possiility of colonizing multiple planets in a star system is a great concept as well. Another plus is the having a Squadron CnC direct control of the Fleets, commanded by an Admiral.  You may wonder what I would like to see added (again) or improved:  1) I would like to see more Stellar systems (up to 350-like the old SOTS) 2) I liked the way the trade software operated in the old SOTS: 1 3) I liked the idea of sharing technology with allies. 4) I liked observing my allies combat segments 5) I would like my spies to be able to steal technology from the enemy.",

One is that it is very in depth, so some people who one a more pick up an play sorta relaxed game this is not it. Secondly its being constantly changed and upgraded, which sadly leads to bugs, but they get patched extremely fast, and that means the game is constantly getting better. Now onto the good parts...  Multiple Races that are very diffrent, want to play as a super agressive race, the Horde can't even engage in diplomacy! They only accept slaves as a payment to not attack now, but later. There is literally a race for every play style.  Tech is also a huge part of the game, and every race can litterally learn every tech, with one small exception. Certain races excell at certain techs, so a race that is horrible at missle technology will begin to research the Tech, then after a turn or 2 be told if they have a chance of researching it or if its just not possible. And even if you are good at a particula tech you may still be told its not possible, so every game is diffrent locking you out an allowing you other tech tress.  Faster then Light travel is important since the galaxy is a big place, and every race way of travelling is vastly diffrent then the other. Being able to move from any star system increasing in speed the farther you are from a star, or constructing warp gates to literally warp from one side of the galaxy to the other wherever you have a gateway, to having node lines interconnecting each star an following them.   Trade, science, exploration, war. This games got it all.",

As it stands spending money on this game is nothing less than an absolute waste of your hard earned cash and should be avoided at all costs. If you are interested in a game like this then pick up the original Sword of the Stars (the first game in the series) since that one, unlike the follow up, isn't a complete mess.

It's still a bit of a mess and in order to play it you either need to be willing to sink plenty of time into fan-made tutorials that may or may not contain the information you actually need or spend days trying to figure it all out for yourself. The game provides little to no explanation of any sort of options and any beginers playing on the recomended settings may find themeselves absolutely curvestomped by a randomly spawning disaster.  Autocombat may be a must as I still run into frequent problems such as the camera locking itself in place and refusing to budge amongst other things. The research isn't all to natural (Though it certainly provides new experiences every time you play as you're forced to adapt.) and races specialising in shields may find themselves with a 1% chance of developing them that just might screw you over if you're not sure how to compensate for it.  In short, either be ready to plow plenty of hours into this game only to be able to grasp it or feel fre to find something else.   ",

A sequel should never be a worse game than the one that preceeded it.

            "review_text": "I'm a pretty big fan of SotS, and I got royally screwed when I purchased the hard copy of Prime. Seems nothing has been learned from that experience. As with Prime SotS2 was as broken as it could on release with more features not working than did. Kerberos made Prime into a great game with its DLC's (though kinda screwed over their initial customers). This seemed to be going into the same direction, but it isnt.  SotS2 is a very nice looking game with a number of really interesting features. However, it still is a very unfinished product and it is very clear Kerberos stopped development. Which would not be that bad if the AI would be able to put up a good fight, specially late game. The AI however can only seem to be able to destroy its own economy.  The default routine for the AI when set to hard is sort of like the following: -Heavy on research, colonization second (you'll easilly outgrow the AI even if you allow the AI to start with 6 planets, even when playing as Hiver). -When the AI meets you, 1-3 turns later it will declare war on you. -AI goes into overdrive redesigning ships and kills its economy trying to build these redesigned ships. -As a results you'll find yourself spammed with small/halfbuild fleets even when you have Leviathans on defense.  Also, research is basicly the same as in Prime. No you dont have to research cruisers, but it is still the same as in Prime as now you just have an extra stage attached to the end. However the extra strage (Leviathans) are boring, slow, strategicly only usefull on defense. Specially so since you can build as many Flagships as you like and below the math: Leviathan: 54CP cost, can fit 2 in a fleet with 2 Dreads or add 5 Dreads. Flagship: 18CP cost, can fit an additional 6 Dreads in the fleet.  Since the Flagship has better speed and is much more affordable you have the choice between a moderatly expensive 7 Dreads-Fleet (Flagship), or a hugelly expensive 1 Leviathan + 5 Dreads-Fleet.  All and all, as a game that should entertain I recommend you stay clear of this and try something else. If you do not care about a (semi-)competitive game, or intend to only use it in MP, it sure is worth €15-ish. I sure do advice you turn of random events and mod out pirates .. boy are those annoying features!",
