And well, it’s bad. But to be really honest, I’ve played worst games? So it’s bad, but not atrocious… I guess. The plot is weak and doesn’t make much sense, the art style is bad, BGs were more or less, BGM was annoying sometimes. The characters felt plain, there’s no development. Also those bears floating on balloons on the menu screen creeped me out, I don’t know why.   3/10.",
