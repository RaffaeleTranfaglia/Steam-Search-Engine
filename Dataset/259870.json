            "review_text": "This game made me blind in my left eye. No joke.  I discovered OMG Zombies! on the PSP, which only has a screen size of 4.3 inches. I am 47 years old, which means my eyes don't work as well as they used to. I should have known better. This game is so addictive that I literally spent somewhere in the neighborhood of eight to ten hours playing it. Continuous. I finished the game, deleted my save, finished the game, deleted my save, and kept right on playing. As a result, I had a massive headache, and the inner lining of my left eye separated, as the ophthalmologist put it, 'like peeling off a sticker.' My eye filled with thousands of tiny, black dots (which were actually quite beautiful and which, I later was told, was blood inside the eye). It required laser surgery to repair, and I was told to avoid using the eye and not to lift anything. Two weeks later, it separated again (because I was being foolish and started using the PSP again). I told you all of that in order to tell you this: I regret nothing.   Nothing!   OMG Zombies (which I've just found on Steam in a bundle that did not interest me, but which I had to purchase  just  in order to share my opinion of the game) is one of those games that offers amazingly simple mechanics, but creative, open-ended strategy (okay, strategy-lite). You are in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, you only have three bullets (to start), and you need to  completely  clear the area of dozens --sometimes, hundreds-- of zombies. Sounds impossible, and it would be were it not for the fact that there are many different types of zombies, and each type behaves differently. Some explode, some shoot rounds off upon dying, some dissolve into pools of acidic goo that, in turn, dissolve any zombie that steps into said pool. Clearing each area awards a bronze, silver, gold, or platinum medal and, with it, different monetary bonuses that allow you to upgrade the zombies, yourself, or the environment (such as exploding barrels). As the levels progress, zombies gain hit points (requiring more damage to kill), and different combinations of zombie type, as well as environmental hazards, appear. You can replay each area to try to gain a higher award.  Let me tell you this: There are few things more satisfying than selecting one specific zombie, firing off a round, and watching it set off a chain reaction that decimates every (un)living thing on the screen. So powerful was the need to do this, that I kept resetting after completion to see if I could handicap myself. How far could I get in the game without purchasing a single powerup (pretty far, as it turns out, although killing every zombie in the area is all but impossible)? Could I successfully complete the game upgrading only soldier zombies? What if I played the game while only upgrading my weapon?  Digital crack, I say. Blind in one eye.   BLIND   in one eye!! And still, I played.  The Steam version adds three more zombie types (the Mortar, Runner, and Zapper), and the graphic novel story presentation, which offers some beautiful artwork, has been expanded. All of that said, the Steam version unfortunately suffers in its execution (no pun intended). The design of the PSP version is one of the most elegant and sleek I've seen; it's intuitive, and virtually everything you need to see is on one screen. On Steam, it's clunky, waaaay oversized, and confusing. Not only that, but the display resolutions are extremely odd (640x362, 1024x580, and 1920x1088, to name a few), resulting in  a level select screen that you can't completely see , no matter the resolution, no matter if the game is fullscreen or windowed. On the PSP, it was easy to tell what upgrades did; here, it's difficult and unintuitive, and that's coming from someone who's played it before (have I mentioned I've played this before?). (EDIT: I've discovered that you can click and drag the level select screen. Maybe a mouseover tooltip would be appropriate for the next patch?)  Still, confusing layout aside, this is a must purchase if this kind of quick-to-pick-up-but-hard-to-put-down game play is your thing (and I suspect you already know if it is). The price is right and, as I said at the start of this review, it's currently bundled for much less. Either way, I'm playing.  Until I lose  both  my eyes.  (Just a quick note to give the dev peace of mind: My eye is almost completely healed now. :) No lawsuit is pending, and you have my eternal gratitude for creating such a great game.   You b*st*rd.)

I've played (and finished) the game on both Steam, PSP and PS3, and all were equally good. Describing the actual game is kind of redundant as the video is pretty descriptive. But the key gameplay is starting chain reactions and upgrading your (and the zombies') abilities.",

It's awfully repetitive, offers only one reward - seeing horde die in a chaotic wave after a succesful shot; and nothing more. But death animations drawn pixel-by-pixel are worth noting.  It could provide interesting plot, but zombie horse is flogged too much to have original premise. Comic doesn't have anything to offer, unfotrunately - drawings and interface have a smell of iOS casual games. And it really has touch interface - no hotkeys, giant buttons, only one mouse button needed to play.   This game can kill several hours of your time and leave nothing in return. (Oh, achevements) I bought it as part of 'sorry for pirating your game' programm, but I shouldn't have launched it.   Also leaderboards are down now.",

Once I completed the game I come to find 'prestige'... After taking 10hrs to complete this game already, which is waaay to much. Now, they want me to do it 5 and 20 times again respectively for the 2 remaining acheivements. Thats just ridiculous. That took me right away from the game and left a bad taste in my mouth. It seems they were trying to increase the life span of a game which is quick and simple. It should have been left that way. Which, in the end made me angry and was a huge mistake.",

In OMG Zombies!, you play as a unnamed riot armour clad police officer who is the sole survivor of a zombie apocalypse in the city of Redfield. For reasons unexplained in-game, the zombies in OMG Zombies! literally explode when shot, showering their zombie brethren with gore and causing chain reactions of showering zombie gibs with just a single bullet. Your cop is going to have to learn to use his rifle to it's fullest potential if he's going to escape Redfield alive. The game is a good stratagy game with great gameplay and graphics. The spritework is incredible, and it has a lot of gore. It also has a ton of unlockable secrets and secret comics that are just incredible. However, overall, OMG Zombies! is a time waster, but it is a very good time waster. If you like stratagy, you should try this game out. If you don't, I wouldn't recommend OMG Zombies!.",

The various types of zombies available, each with its own abilities. The ability to beef your sniper, but not only that you can build the attributes of the zombies as well. Strong attributes, easier and mor devistating kills :)  This is a game, that not ranking high on my list, I will play to lose myself for a couple hours. For those who enjoy this style of game, I think, with the Zombie Apocolypse mania that abounds these days, this would be a wonderful game.",

However, if you want to have a fun time and get all the achievements done, I would not recommend this game.  In this game, you shoot exploding zombies to make a chain reaction with three to six bullets in a level. There are 100 levels and they can be quite tough to beat if you make mistakes in upgrading on zombies, explosive barrels or your rifle. The idea of the game could be fun, but the current game is not because of the fact it almost depends on your luck, not on your skill. It seems all the settings (starting locations of zombies and exploding barrels, moving directions and duration of zombies, and so on) depends on randomness, and the player cannot control this randomness at all, except to choose retry. You will have to try around 15 times (in average) to eliminate all the zombies in a level. If you prefer fulfilling achievements, you have to repeat beating all the levels 21 times. It is a long journey of rather just throwing a dice so many times, not challenging your skills. There is a seldom chance of joy in watching your careful one shot resulting in a complete massacre of zombies.  There should be some modification to allow players to apply their skills; a bait, a yelling, barrels located more dispersed (or designed), environmental kills (falling obstacles to kill zombies and limit their movements afterwards), or zombie attributes attracting other zombies.",
