            "review_text": "Block Legend DX is an attempt of a game to strategize and plan your moves in an RPG match-3(match-2 actually) fashion. Games like 10,000,000 or You must build a boat but in a tactical and slower pace.   Compared to those 2 games where you need to be fast, In Block Legend DX, you must carefully maintain your board so you have something to use or don't get stuck especially for the final boss. Another difference is this game is also a rouge-like, so when you die, you're going to start a new game. You grind for the star blocks which is the only currency in-game, it is used for everything like:  - Character unlock - Dungeon/Place unlock - Starting Item and consumable  What I don't really like is the third one, having to pay for the starting item and consumable. Not only you need to grind for unlocks, it makes the grind slower if you opted to bring a starting item/weapon.  I really like the idea in this game, also the difficulty is ok to me since you actually need to think rather than using your reflexes. You need to actually prioritize stats, and not do a jack of all trades build, but the progression kills it for me. Too grindy and that cost for the starting item/consumable is too much. Finally, the difficulty spikes: Unlike 10,000,000 and YMMB, those 2 games have a nice difficulty spike, but this game, I can't even pass the third boss because once you there, you only have 2 turns to do ♥♥♥♥ while he does 20dmg+ to you.  For the PC port, I don't recommend this game. Meanwhile, I'm currently downloading this on my phone.",

            "review_text": "This is SUPPOSED to be an RPG/Puzzle hybrid. There's no RPG element to this game except in the very vague sense. It wouldn't even be so bad if the 'Puzzle' aspect were challenging, but it's not. It's basically a 'Click Two' game...Not a 'Swap and Three' game. You simply click on any batch of icons that are 2 or more connected.   The puzzle aspect reminds me a bit of Destruct-O-Match from NeoPets...Except not as entertaining and instead of being free they are trying to sucker you out of 5 bucks.",

            "review_text": "Normally, I'm a sucker for match-3 games. This one, though, gets a couple of things wrong that push it into unplayable territory.  Firstly, it's very, very clearly a mobile port. Not that there's anything wrong with that. But to play using items costs 'Starbucks' or whatever, which you earn by doing quests. Absent in the steam version is presumably the microtransaction store where you can buy more Canadough to unlock them.  Secondly, it's not terribly deep. After playing vastly more strategic match-3s like HuniePop (which isn't very deep, but vastly more engaging than this), this is simplistic, at best. The strategy boils down to 'match lots of hearts and shields'.  Lastly, though, and most inexcusably is the fact that the gameplay is sluggish, unresponsive, and disengaging. Every time the monster does something, it flashes a huge red warning on the screen and blocks your input. Given that I play these games with a Wacom tablet and have no issues playing FAST the lockout of input every time the monster does something renders this basically unplayable for me. Given that the game forces you to match hearts/shields AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, explicitly making it go slow is mindboggling.  Give this one a pass.",
