I was still underaged and this was a game I looked forward too after school, playing together with your classmates and rek them obviously. I quit a long time ago, went to high school and needed to set priorities.   Well, now it's at Steam I came back and I made a new account because I forgot my old one, surprise. Even I have to start over it's still a great game. Yes, you've to wait at things like people complain but ever thought about letting it run while you play another game? Easily solved. The game is easy to understand and there is competition to be the best.",

I'm recommending it because structurally it's okay, i'm just too casual and spastic to focus on anything that doesn't reward you with candy every five minutes.",

            "review_text": "Shakes and Fidget is a free to play animated 2D style RPG with multiplayer and everything RNG. It is also a web browser and mobile game, so it will be populated with other players. It worked, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok, was understandable. The levelcap is 550, but it will take you long time to reach it. Mushrooms are the store currency, but you can earn some from in quests rewards and gambling. Some gear cost mushrooms, but you might find the same and better later for gold only or quest reward. You can spend mushrooms to skip waiting on timers or add time to questing endurance and the best mount. You do need to buy mushrooms to level your guild past 25.  It has PVP and PVE. It is RNG combat where better stats and gear will give you the edge, but RNG is a fickle goddess, you still can lose to bad rolls. You can make three characters, using 3 classes ( warrior, mage, scout). You can raise your all your stats with gold and use potions to temporary improve a stat. It has 16 dungeons you can unlock and raid. At level 75, you can collect Pets that improve your stats and you can fight other players pets. There are other things that you can do to improve your stats.    You can make your own fortresss, with some buildings that improve your character. You can raid other players forts for resources and pour your gold in to defending your fort. It has Guilds and guild wars, where guild members all attack other guilds or defend from other guild's attacks. Guilds have stuff they can build that improves the lives of guild members. But above level 25 guild upgrades require someone that buys mushrooms.  Try it, maybe you might like it.   For more info:         YouTube™ Video:  Shakes and Fidget Gameplay - First Look HD&nbsp;",

Someone also said this game was greedy? because the lowest he could pay is 9,99 for 130 mushrooms(which btw are alot), no the lowest is for 4,99 for 50 mushrooms and I am sure i remember shakes and fidgets sending me emails on holidays like thanksgiving, valentines day etc giving me free mushrooms so no, this game is everything but greedy.  TL:DR; It's cool, not buy to win, meh why not?",

It's more of a social game when joining a guild, and just some very casual game on which you can spend 20s every 30 minutes from work or while alt+tabbing from another online thing.  And no, it's not really pay to win, while it sure makes things easier, a LOT of top players have never spent a $ on this. What makes people win is time, time, and more time, paying for anything really gives nothing but a tiny tiny one-time boost.  Also, for those who says this kind of games has no place on Steam, one reason they probably never thought about: for people who don't have, and don't want to have Flash installed, having them here is great :)",

Heck, even games where you can skip scenes/sweep to gain xp, gold, or items are less mindless than literally just letting this game run in the background while you do other stuff. In the 13 hours or so I've 'played' this game, less than an hour was actually spent with the screen in front of me. It's *that much* of a waiting game. There aren't even any achievements.  It has it's good points as well, I'll have to admit. Art is cute and the text can be quite humorous. But there's no actual plot, there aren't any actual things that you *need* to do to progress, and there's just... waiting. The graphics and aesthetic doesn't make the lack of actual content disappear.  I'll keep it installed simply because I'm that kind of person, and by that, I mean the kind of person that doesn't mind waiting. But I know most people would even loathe to call this a game, satire or not, so I guess Shakes and Fidget is not a game I can recommend.",

Unfortunately, once I started playing, I realized that this game is unbelievably boring.  This game seems to consist of perpetual grinding to reach some unacheivable level in the hopes that the game might eventually get interesting. All you do is accept quests, wait five minutes for it to load, and then watch a fight play out (a fight which you have no control over) and then you go and do it all again. Or, if you're feeling adventurous, you can go to the Arena and get paired against another player who hopelessly, hilariously outguns you, and lose twice the honor you gained in your previous NPC fights. You can buy weapons, armor, and potions that up your stats, but they're expensive and give barely-noticeable boons. Supposedly, you can start building a fortress, or go fight in dungeons, but it won't give me any fortress points to start building or keys to start pillaging dungeons.  This game seems entirely pointless to me. All I end up doing is checking emails while I wait for fights to load. The only props I can give this game is that the artwork is legitimately beautiful--you can stare at it for ten minutes while you wait for your fights to load.  1.5 out of 10",

Easy to Understand Very intuitive, go to the Tavern for Quests.  2. Nice Graphics Simple web comic quality.  CONS 1. Pay To Win The in-game cash currency is called Mushrooms. You go to a shady dealer to pay cash for shrooms.  2. Shops You need to use 1 Mushroom (cash currency) just to refresh the shop.  3. Boring Stats and Classes 3 Classes Mage, Warrior and Scout   8 races  Orc (Strength +1, Dexterity -1)  Elf (Strength -1, Dexterity +2, Constitution -1) Gnome (Strength -1, Dexterity +3, Intelligence -1, Constitution -1) Demon (Strength +3, Dexterity -1, Constitution +1, Luck -3) Human (No changes) Dwarf (Dexterity -2, Intelligence -1, Constitution +2, Luck +1) Dark Elf (Strength -2, Dexterity +2, Intelligence +1, Constitution -1) Goblin (Strength -2, Dexterity +2, Constitution -1, Luck +1)  4.

Pros: - RPG progression instead of time-based progression. - Character costumization.  Cons: - Almost no sound (only attack sound) - Waiting game, just like mobile games these days where you press fight and let the system do the thing. - Little ways (to none) to communicate with other players  I wish Steam allows neutral rating reviews, because I love idle games, yet it will turn most players down because its a waiting game, with little interaction to do and with almost no way to communicate with other players (yet they still call this as an MMO).",

If idle games aren't your cup of tea, don't do this game (I do idle games because it gives me a small reprieve from doing work), but if idle games are your thing, good for you. Obviously, this game is pay-to-play (even though you have the ability to play without spending a dime, but spending money makes it a hell of a lot easier) and the 'funny, quirky humor' isn't in the game at all. Yes, the game does have its moments, but it's far and few between. I'm personally, still going to play this game because hey, freedom, but this isn't the best game out there (just a semi-par). I do admire the artwork and the comics, though. One suggestion I have is to input a little D&amp;D minigame to add to the quirkiness and humor. Anyways, this game isn't meant for everyone, even though I want to give this game a good review, I can't (although, I still will play it).",
