            "review_text": "Obulis is a puzzle game that relies on physics, momentum and gravity. There are colored balls hanging in chains and using various items obtained in the map, the player has to guide those balls to the respective colored pots.  It is a great game, beginning with simple levels and gradually progressing on to harder and complex levels as the game progresses.  Some levels are actually easier than the others, even though they award higher stars of completion than other tougher levels. But this is just me, difficulty actually will vary from player to player. Some levels are constrained by your timing - it just has to be perfect or you lose. You definitely will be wanting to tear your head off at some of the tougher levels.  Obulis being one of the oldest games in genre, may seem lacking in advanced features but nowhere will the gameplay dull out. All levels occur at different loactions, each with its' own set of objects that can be utilized to help the player accomplish his goal.  All being said, this is a great game, containing upto 10 hours of fun gameplay.",

            "review_text": "Obulis is a wonderful physics-based puzzle game that will really put your brain to work. Through 150 levels, colored marbles found on platforms and hanging from chains must be knocked into their respective colored pots while the grey marbles, which are only used as tools to move colored ones, must not.  Chains are highlighted and cut with the mouse and you'll have to make use of order, timing of cuts and shots, and momentum from swinging, rolling and bouncing marbles to make it all work. There are also cannons, catapults, crossbows and moving platforms you'll have to work with. Difficulty varies wildly and there can be multiple solutions for a level, with some making you feel like a genius and some feeling like pure dumb luck.  The mobile game Cut the Rope has some similarities if you've ever played it, but Obulis is more serious and challenging.",

The game is pretty relaxing, has a nice calm soundtrack and some good ambient-type sound effects. The puzzles work their way up from very easy to very challenging in a way that doesn't have you tearing your hair out too much. Overall I liked it and look forward to seeing what the developers bring out next.",

            "review_text": "Obulis is your standard physics puzzle game. You try to get the balls in their containers by hitting off of walls and other balls, rolling on platforms, and swinging off of chains. It's a pretty known concept, but the different environments created for the game definitely make the game a relaxing one. There are about 150 different puzzles to solve, and they range from simple to master difficulty, with 6 difficulties in between.  I read the other reviews written so far, and I gotta say I disagree completely with them; If you repeat a level, and do exactly the same moves every time, you will always yield the same result. By definition, that means there isn't any luck involved. Some levels do take a bit of precise timing, but they tend to have large margins for error, and the levels reset very quickly, so it's not like messing up takes too much time. All you need to solve the puzzles is a bit of patience (only necessary for the hard ones) and a brain (also really only necessary for the hard ones).  It took me about 6 hours to get through all of the levels and unlock all of the achievements. For a puzzle game with a fairly simple premise, I think that's more than good enough. I was fortunate enough to be gifted a copy of this game, but I feel like it's worth the $5 normal price, given that for me, that's like $0.80/hr of gameplay. And if you don't think it's worth it, pretty much all steam games go on sale 4 times a year, usually for more than half-off.  If you like Casual games, if you like puzzle games, if you care about atmosphere as much as gameplay, then I would recommend this game to you.",

It's obvious why the gameplay mechanics would work for a touchscreen device, but they don't translate over well to a pc. This is in part because of the rather bad game design (why can't you just drag your mouse to cut the ropes?), and in part because the game is just really slow paced. It's not relaxing as much as it's just boring.",
