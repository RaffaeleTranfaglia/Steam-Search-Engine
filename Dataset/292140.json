Having bought this nearly a month after the Steam release and bearing in mind all the comments on the poor performance of the game, it is very disappointing that there has been no fix for this yet.  In short, it doesn't matter if you have the pc, it still won't run smoothly. Please fix this soon! I would recommend this game to anyone AFTER a fix has been released.",

            "review_text": "/soapbox on  I know it gets some bad press from the Meat Grinder; but listen here; This game is far and above the game that drove me away from the series in the first place (also happens to, at this late hour, restore my faith in Final Fantasy). Yes, the story is a bit simple; and the combat system largely hasn't changed. But look - Did Final Fantasy 13 Ever have anything to do with Time Travel? Did it even begin to address the problem that up until 13 they had been adding content to the series left and right that had little or no value in gaming terms? Absolutely not. 13 Was a sad story of how a little boy and a few girls got beat up by a monster and crystalized, turned into some kind of magical alien in the interrim. It was even worse than 12's handling of the world map; even worse than the fact that FF11 was completely and stupidly MMO-Mode only. Let's face it 13 was BAD. XIII-2 gives it a second shot, and hey they still didn't get it all right but they atleast listened to their fans. What else can you ask for in a developer than a good player/dev conversation? Most Devs prior to Final Fantasy XIII-2 will tell you straight that they don't give a damn about anyone but themselves. This has largely changed by the time of the port because of things like Early Access Titles on Steam, and the community taking a sincere interest in making a better game out of a good game. OK So   /soapbox off  It's a good game. But it's just my opinion, same as that jerk who wrote the 2014 corporate review thinks it's a bad game. The Only difference between him and I are taste, and tact, and maybe a considerable viewing populace.

            "review_text": "Despite the best efforts of Lightning and her crew, the world is once again in danger. Now it's up to Serah, mysterious traveler Noel, and moogling Mog to make things right. Despite putting 50+ hours into FFXIII-2, I'm about as equipped to discuss the plot as somebody who has never even heard of the game....or Final Fantasy.   I guess this title could be compared to previous Square games like Chrono Trigger &amp; Chrono Cross. The player must pass through various times and dimensions, alleviating paradoxes, fighting monsters, and getting pushed around by some jerk named Caius. There are dark moments (like Chrono), but it sticks to 3-4 characters, instead of attempting to juggle 300 (like Cross). I guess that's part of what got me through this game. When the story doesn't make a lot of sense, at least you can watch the friendship between Noel &amp; Serah grow, and realize that they're getting by despite the heaps of BS being tossed their way.  The battle-system is straight outta FFXIII, but with numerous changes. The most obvious is that the third party member is always a monster. Pocket Monster fans are going to find dozens of creatures to recruit throughout their journey. Monsters are strengthened via materials, and can be infused with others to gain additional skills. Admittedly, I was a little disappointed that monsters adhere to the FFXIII system. For example, I recruited a Giant Cactaur, but he's not going around using 100,000 needles on everything. He's a synergist so he sticks entirely to buffs. I know I know, the paradigms are essential to winning in FFXIII, but I just...oh well. On the bright side, monsters tend to have unique skills that make them more effective in a given situation than Serah &amp; Noel.   On the whole, FFXIII-2 is a fair bit easier than its predecessor. This is mostly due to the fact that you're actually not limited in how much you can grind. Since this game is non-linear, you could go to various optional areas and amass a ton of levels, making the story-battles trivial. Aside from a handful of post-game &amp; DLC fights, you'll have to limit yourself if you want a challenge.  Speaking of levels, the Crystarium got a convoluted revamp. You cash in points for stat bonuses: +3 to magic, +20 to HP, etc. Over time you unlock and level all six roles, but your level 99 stats can vary. There's a 'perfect' guide floating around to help you figure this mess out. While I ended up using guides to have a chance at 100%ing this game, I merely stuck to leveling what I thought would make sense. For Serah, I leveled Ravager on the large nodes to boost her magic, and with Noel, commando. I probably goofed somewhere and cost myself a good 30+ points in an essential stat, but I've done most everything in the game, so it isn't that much of an issue.  In order to get all 160 fragments, you're going to be doing a lot of exploring, grinding, puzzles, and stupid pet tricks. Mog is capable of finding hidden items, and can also be thrown to reach faraway objects (which you might need a guide to find). The puzzles are almost entirely mini-games. As anyone who has played FFXIII-2 will tell you, the clock puzzles SUCK. Most of them aren't that difficult and can be brute-forced. But there are a few that all but require a website for calculating solutions. Either take advantage of the tools the internet has made available to you, or watch in horror as the pacing dies a painful death, your choice. The grind isn't quite as bad as FFXIII, but expect to spend a lot of time in the Archylte Steppe fighting the same monsters for potent orbs, essences, &amp; crystals.   After completing the game, all of the major DLC is unlocked. In the Coliseum, players will engage in battle with numerous fan-favorites, and a few characters from FFXIII. I find it amusing that one of the opponents should have been in a boss-fight in FFXIII, but it never happened because reasons. I won't spoil it, but if you played FFXIII, then you already know who I'm talking about. You'll want to fight these battles not just because they're quite good, but also because you can recruit everyone you defeat. The next DLC adventure is a solo battle between Lightning and Caius. Lightning has a specific set of roles, and is expected to switch between them constantly. For example, she can use the knight role to become impervious to damage, and it's necessary to avoid getting one-shotted by a handful of Caius's attacks. Since this DLC doesn't require Serah &amp; Noel, you can do it immediately after completing the game to gain a powerful ally.   Sazh's DLC adventure takes place in a Casino. He's trapped in limbo, and his son is nowhere to be found, only by gambling can they hope to be re-united. While the concept sounds sufficiently dark, this isn't exactly Gambling Apocalypse Sazh. The goal is to acquire 30 fortune medals, which can be done in less than 30 minutes by playing Texas Hold'em. The casino is also available in the main-game, though all N&amp;S can do is play slots and race their chocobos. Once I got the items I required, I never went back.   I'll admit, I enjoyed my time with this game more than FFXIII. Noel, Serah, and Caius are some of the better JRPG heroes and villains I've seen. Trying to make sense of everything is headache-inducing, but the revamped crystarium and monster-raising provided excellent distractions. The combat itself also recieved some slight improvements, like paradigm shifting being noticeably faster. The various areas/times/dimensions being more than a narrow corridor definitely helped, though the quests tend to be of the fetching variety.   The port still could have been a lot better though. I'm not nearly as frustrated about it now as was when I started the PC version, but Square-enix isn't getting a passing grade for this one. FFXIII and its sequel deserve better ports, but I expect Lightning Returns to be at about the same quality as the previous two PC entries; superior to the console versions, and not much else.",

            "review_text": "Warning. This is a personal review. Everyone has their own opinions and Mine are just shown throughout this review.  If you did not play the first game do not worry you are not missing out too much. HOWEVER  This game is much more open compared to the significantly linear FF13. I believe that is one reason why people hated the first game. This game will use various tactics to keep you from progressing at a later point in the game which really will annoy anyone who plays this game. The puzzle challenges for example are by far the most annoying additions to this game. COULD BE LIKE ANY OTHER FF GAME WITH A BOSS BUT NO. PUZZLE CHALLENGES ARE ALL THE RAGE. Seriously, that crap made me stop playing. And sure I could go and watch someone do them, but I'd rather do it myself, especially seeing as my network connection isnt that great especially with video content.  ANYWAY other than the annoyances  For the good things so far  -RESOLUTIONS:  CAN CHANGE TO SOMETHING OTHER THAN 720p  -A lot of elements from the first game reappear, giving you some idea just how the first game went.  -A LOT of crap people hated in the first game is fixed  (Like, if the leader dies, it used to be game over, yeah no, thats gone now)  -If you have played Tales of Symphonia 2 THIS GAME FEELS SLIGHTLY LIKE IT Well in battle that is. You will only have two playable characters, and other characters like Snow joining in, but not in the party as they are not of the same timeline.  -You will also be able to collect monsters to help in battle which is cool. Oh they also troll you a bit by making the game look like an older FF tittle, (like with an actual level system) But its not.  -You get all DLC from the ps3 version included too!  TL:DR the game is vastly more simplified than the original, My guess is the creators saw how annoying the first game was and aimed to change it up somewhat.  The bad  -THERE IS NO LINUX PORT. STEAM TROLLS YOU.  -Character selection and world/timeline selection can be a pain to deal with at first and for some reason to me if feels like I'm playing kingdom hearts in a way due to Noels looks, however like all games you play for hours, you will get used to it.  -The AI has a mind of its own, screwing up story lines, in more than one way. --Becareful how you talk to people, the camera may be in an odd position  -Grinding does help lots here, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GAME TROLLS YOU TO TAKE ON BOSSES WAY HIGHER LEVEL INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH THE WHOLE MISSON TO MAKE IT EASIER.  -Graphics options are available although limited. SE seemed to have borrowed the settings changer that was created for the first game, however I will say one thing..   &gt;&gt;There is no option to change the texture quality, so you WILL NEED A HIGH END PC FOR THIS GAME&lt;&lt;  -Even though its a PS3 Port, the game has a significant performance hit even on low settings. So if you played the first game, thinking you can play the second one easily, think again.  -The AUTOSAVE FEATURE WILL KILL YOU: By being stressed out, as for some reason steam needs to be not only online and active, but if steam gets disconnected, the game will LOCK UP DURING AUTOSAVE MOMENTS. Just keep that in mind if you have a faulty internet connection or you are playing during times where steam goes down for repairs.  -----------------------------------------------------  Over all I have nothing really bad to say about this port. This game does however raise the question on if i shall buy the third installment of FF13 as even though the first game was mainly linear, I preferred it over this one currently. There is alot Square could do to make this game better and a lot of things that i hope do not transition to FF15 when it does arrive, assuming it comes out for PC. anywho gameplay wise It is much better to play over the original, and even though there could be a few more fixes here and there. I'm sure with the right system you would be able to play this game maxed out, however currently this game is as demanding as something like witcher 2 So keep that in mind when trying to play this game.  Also for you tech heads out there, this game is multi(meaning 2) threaded. High clocked strong CPU cores are recommended. (so FX minumum, Intel core i7 or something above 4ghz) GPU Wise: RADEON HD 7870/7790 and above / NVidia GTX 750 TI and above (for 1080p gameplay) Ram isn't really an issue, so minimum being 3gb, lol.

            "review_text": "Given the mixed reception the Final Fantasy 13 series seems to be getting about its ports, I thought I'd throw my opinion in on this aswell.  As a game, Final Fantasy 13-2 is somewhat of an improvement on its predecessor in terms of gameplay and in my own opinion fun. It gives you a lot more freedom in terms of what you want to do during the course of the game and although you will eventually have to follow the main story to progress to later stages of the game, you could easily go ahead and just burn another 3 or 4 hours here and there just exploring and gaining more CP for your characters, materials for your monsters and finding those pesky Artefacts.  On the topic of levelling, yes it is a little annoying because the game doesn't fully go over the system and if you are not careful you can indeed make your character weaker because of it. Although it does pretty much imply the way they should be setup with Noel being Strength and Serah being Magic, it doesn't explicitly state it nor does it tell you that you can easily waste CP and Role levels on nodes that give little to no actual benefit which is a slight issue but not one that should make anybody overlook the game, it's trial and error.  The third party member in the team will consist of a Monster character, which you find various items to level up unlike the usual CP used for the main PCs. The ability to gain, level and infuse said monsters to make a third player who could be a huge asset to any party you make is a huge plus to it. With that, you can take up to 3 Monsters into a battle as part of a Paradigm Pack, which lets you add them to your current Paradigm setups then change the roles freely to (hopefully) change the tide of battle upon change. Also Paradigm Shifting is a bit quicker, which I personally found a little bonus.  The story itself could be confusing, especially if you haven't played the original and it can also get a bit crazy to follow too if you do things in an odd order or seek out Artefacts all the time. It's solid, but it isn't the best and possibly one of the very few things I can pick on within the game.  Overall it is a solid game, not amazing by Final fantasy standards but it is worth a go if you played Final Fantasy 13 or really any version of the Final Fantasy series in the past, or if you are like me and just love playing RPGs.",

I have an Nvidia Geforce GTX 980 and an Intel I7 4770k with 16 GB system RAM. The game works just fine for me, however, when I try to play the game at 1080p, I find that the FPS is highly unstable. It goes anywhere from 20-60 FPS, depending on what is going on. Prerendered cutscene: 30 FPS (although the video itself was only rendered at 30 FPS anyway). In-engine cutscene: 60 FPS. Menu: 40-60 FPS. Running around: 20-60 (again, it depends on what is going on).  Now, that being said, I have tweaked with the settings and I have found something that works for me: -Resolution: 1600x900 -Fullscreen -Shadow Resolution: 2k -AA: 8x  With this setup I was able to play the game at a much more stable 40-60 FPS, depending on the situation. I will also note that I am using a device to measure the amount of wattage that my computer uses and I noticed that it uses almost the same amount of power as it does when I idle on the desktop. This isn't a problem for me, however I will say that it is not pushing my system to it's limits, as is normal for console ports these days.",

It starts with some cinamatic that doesnt explain anything then u have to mash some buttons with the cineamtic scene then more random stuff happens. suddenly you get to the sister this, sister that drama. where is the skip button? why cant I cut scenes? how about you say something that actually proceeds with the plot? i been playing for abit over 1 hour for now and the over repeated 'i want my sister, i wish my sister was here, oh i saw my sister' drama made me hate this game.   ADD A SKIP BUTTON to scenes that has nothing to do with plot.   played for over oe hour and here is how much the plot advanced. lighting send a guy to her sister.

Someone needs to tell this lady that her sister isnt a diary. she went over from 'where is my sister' to fully talking to her as if she is her diary. her symptoms are getting worse.  and still the story didnt advance alot. plot wise nothing. 17 hours of going from one place to another while fighting enemies and watching plotless movies (thank you skip button). i think they focused on gameplay and threw the story away. another thing to cmplain about which no one mentioned. hese is a stutter in the game every 2 seconds which SEEMS to be fixed when an xbox controller is connected (weird?) .",

Look on the Steam forums for potential hardware issues (AMD CPU/GPU owners especially) and only decide after reading around. Depending on your rig, this game either works fine or with a tonne of issues (if at all). Sadly, I am in the latter group.  However, the game itself is really enjoyable. I originally played it on the PlayStation 3 so I have prior and relevent experience with it.   It is a relatively easy game as far as Final Fantasy titles go - even moreso if you're a well-seasoned RPGer and spend a lot of time exp grinding / farming. Aside from the main content of the story, there are quite a few additional things you can amuse yourselves with: chocobo racing, completing the monster log, slot machines, additional areas to explore, min-maxing pets and of course, the PC version comes with all of the DLC included.  The environments are varied and interesting, full of colour and detail. In addition to the main characters, you're able to capture and train a pet for the third party slot. They will fulfil a specific role (Medic, Saboteur, Ravager etc.) and you can build paradigm sets to suit your play style.  FFXIII-2 is designed with casual play in mind, I believe. There's a catch-up cutscene every time you load a previously-saved game, to remind you of your progress in the main story missions. This game also has, in my opinion, one of the best Final Fantasy soundtracks in recent years.  Worth a try, certainly.  If you can get it working properly. ",

Im gonna start with Serah (stupid spelling), i never liked her character in ff13, she seemed like the demsel in distress and that is a pathetic character role. Here she starts off just like thats to quote 'Lightning help me' while she cowers.... she changes almost instantanious into a more confident ♥♥♥♥ing Blues Clues lets see what we can find here ♥♥♥♥. She is essentially Vanille from FF13.  Noel is basically a male lightning with a bit better people skills, doesn't have the keep up or die attitude that lightning had at the start of FFXIII. I don't know why but they are doing the typical bs of drip feeding background information to the player has if Noel knows all the answers from the start and wants to keep them to himself to quote chapter 3, He sees this device and straight away goes how did you get that? knowing full well what it is and what it does then plays it off that he only mildly read about it and isnt that well known on the subject..... what an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.   Now the story, this feels so tacked on to make money its not funny. Its like they had no idea where to go from 13 so they just chose the lazy option and was like TIME TRAVEL!!! yep that solves every ♥♥♥♥ing issue. Because you time travel there is literally no flow to the game. You start off in your normal timeline then jump a head a little then a little more then just 200 years etc. I just doesnt seem rewarding when you finish an area and it just takes you back to a menu to pick the next time zone or a previous time zone to replay. I think sure if you missed something or want to go back to collect everything possible, that is useful but as far as creating a flowing story it feels like a stop everytime you finish a level and its like do i want to pick this up again? I know the next mission is just gonna be go here, talk to them, kill that, collect an artifact and rinse and repeat. It just doesnt feel fun, doesnt feel like there is an actual story, or cut scenes, havn't seen many pre rendered cut scenes like FF is famous for. Now i havn't finished the game yet because im strougling to stay interested in this game.  Puzzles, I believe that since they didn't have to worry about writing a proper story they could put more content into the game, being these 'Temperal Paradoxs'. Well I suppose they are more like distractions from the main story and have very little depth involved in completed them.   the crystaium I find now is just a mess comapred to 13 where you had those floating crystals and then the circles around them, now you just press A (playing with a controller) and you level up your class.   the lack of characters in this game and replacing your 3rd character with a monster is both creative but takes away from any possible character development you might make being that once again THERE IS NO ACTUAL STORY LINE HERE and by adding more characters to this would almost make it worse because your Moogle is basically your 3rd character and it is just Serah's weapon (makes no ♥♥♥♥ing sense, typical jrpg kawaii stuff).  FF13 started of straight away with action and good character development, its just ♥♥♥♥ing kawaii ♥♥♥♥ with Serah being a pathetic character Noel being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ drip feeding the player information to prolong the NON EXSISTANT STORY and there Moogle which has almost NO pressance in 13 but is now appropriate for 13-2.  the port is just god awful, im running a superclocked 970 gtx and when i ran this on 1080p 8k shading, this raining mission towards the start of the game gave me 10fps..................................... i rate this 2/10 cause FF has decent hair modelling.",

XIII-2 doesn't have the same level of polish that the first game has even though the port is much better thsi time around, meaning it has a very inconsistent difficulty level and some rather arbitrary mechanics, but the wide variety of new features, an overall improved battle system, and a still-stellar soundtrack make this a game worth playing for the price. The visuals are also spectacular in moments, particularly near the beginning and end, but a painfully padded middle-game really shows that they did not give nearly as much effort to the aethetics in the core of the experience. If you are able to get through a lot of the padding, you'll find a fun game with some moments on par with the high points in its predecessor, particularly the boss battles. Overall, though, the added visual options are a great touch and if you set your rig to maximize performance, you'll get some really smooth gameplay. While I have not played the entirety of the game on PC, I have completed it on PS3 and this review is based on my initial impressions. I will change them if anything significant lowers my opinion later on in the game.",

This game is simply a port of its console predesessor. And that is what I'm calling it through this review.   My PC's specs aren't high end, it's completely running on factory hardware. And I can play games such as Path of Exile and Call of Duty AW without much trouble, if any. And I'm running on 6 GB of RAM with an AMD A8 Quad-Core processor. Final Fantasy XIII ran almost PERFECTLY with very little chugging when the particles started flying. So as a PORT this game fails to meet what I would consider even sub-par standards that we've come to expect from an A-class company.  This game needs some serious patching. So if you're intending to buy this game, think hard about your rig's specs. This game may not hold up to your expectations, at least for now.",

Even using NVIDIA control panel to give a performance boost does ZERO to help increase FPS. Regardless of whether you play the game with x16 MSAA, or x2, you receive the same FPS. Same with the shadow quality slider option. If anything, it ran slightly smoother with maxed graphics quality than lesser. Not to mention the audio is all over the place. Voices are too loud in cutscenes, too soft everywhere else, and there is no in-game slider to balance it out. Once (or IF) patched and stabilized, it will be as much fun as it was for the PS3. If it doesn't receive the needed patches/updated optimizations, steer clear of this game for the PC.  [Updated - 12-16-2014]  After clearing the very first area, the fps improved by 10, which is apparently a huge deal for this particular game. Game is now playable at a constant 20-30 fps, with the only increase over that being 50-60 for menu/blank loading screens.  Idk what all was going on graphically in the first area, but it must have had some serious graphic drainers. Hopefully they patch this game eventually like how they did with FF13's fps stability update. Adding an ingame option to change the various sound levels would be nice too.

Pros: Fun high paced style very different from previous FF games. Great animations and environments. Lots of freedom to explore and extra challenges to face. Good voice acting and excelent music.  Cons: QTE finishers on boss monsters. I hate QTE sequences I'm sure some people love them just not for me. No limit breaks. Your monsters get limit breaks which can be mildly powerful but your characters don't get them they get these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ super spells that can only be used once a fight and do only slightly more damage than normal moves. Auto attacking is more effective than trying to cue up abilities manually. The fighting is too fast to navigate the menus and select the ideal combos (especially if you are hasted in a boss fight) and auto select does a decent job so why even bother? Only having two people is novel but I didn't like it. Requires grinding areas for rare monster crystals which could take tens of hours if you're unlucky. Story is hard to follow even for a time travel game. Limited customization in character leveling. (again only two characters and they can be maxed out pretty quick) No crafting or ultimate weapons. Capacity limit or status ailments makes good gear worse (better to stack delicate low level items for synergy bonus). Repetitive zones. It's cool you can go to the same place at different ages but it's the exact same map you play though 3 sometimes 4 times. No new monsters or bosses. Same exact monsters and abilities and differet time periods have the same mobs just a different color pallet. No fun mini games. The casino is dull the poker can only be played after the game is beaten and even then the opponents are predictable and no fun to play against. Slot machines are worthless. Ending sucks. No spoilers just know that the ending along with pretty much all the Pardox Endings are sh*tty.  Final verdict.  It was fun and I did throw a bunch of hours into the game collecting almost all the fragments and getting the various endings but the poor story, poor character development, and lame ending are all major turn offs.

Sure, it still has that slght repetitiveness that FFXIII had, but this time the world at least feels more open and not so much a 'walk down this corridor and fight lots of enemies ad infinitum' feel that its predecessor had.  I know there are meant to be issues with the port, and my FPS fluctuates wildly between 20-60 all the time, but I can't say I've actually noticed any difference when it does (i.e. lagging or screen-tearing), so can't comment on the actual issues themselves.

It has the requisite production values, large scope, interesting battle system, monster variety, and pretty much everything else you'd expect. Square Enix did well in taking a very different direction than the game's predecessor. The ultra-restricted linearity is gone, replaced with far more explorable environments - and, at a macro level, the ability to time hop. It doesn't get much more nonlinear than that.  But the overall result is disappointing.  When it all comes down to it, one of the central game mechanics becomes 'find and do as much as you can.' This kind of approach can be entirely functional and fun. It works wonderfully for the 'Mass Effects,' 'Elder Scrolls,' and 'Fallouts' of the world. The problem is that 'XIII-2' chooses to go the route of the 3D pixel hunt. That is, hints and direction are quite sparse, when they're around at all, and certain things (especially the Archylte Steppe) come down to a process of walking around every inch of an area you've already seen, hoping to run across something new. Which character offers quests? Who knows! What actually has an effect on this part of the gameworld? Who knows!  The mixture is both boring AND frustrating, which is not a recipe for a happy player.  Now, this kind of thing has been found in the 'Final Fantasy' series before. It's just that it's very, very optional. Completing the game is usually about the core mechanics of character development and party management, with some very powerful goodies thrown in for the person who pokes their nose into everything. In 'XIII-2,' poking your nose into everything is much more central to finishing the storyline - and that can make it rather maddening. The game suffers from a case of 'Guide Dang It' (where you would never logically figure out an element from gameplay alone) more than any other 'Final Fantasy' I've played.  'XIII-2,' like its predecessor, also has a case of a suddenly steep difficulty curve. You'll find a combat groove, and it will work all the way to the end of the game...and then the final battle occurs, and...looks like we need to go hunting around for more things in places we never thought to look! Let's try talking to everybody again. Again! While getting attacked by monsters the whole way! Again! Some more!  Sigh.  And then, you finally get to the ending, and it lacks any real payoff at all. (I can't say too much without spoiling things, but my reaction pretty much sums up as, 'They can't actually be serious about this, can they?')  As a final note, I have to say that I just dislike the whole 'time travel and alternate universes' thing. It really worked for 'Dr. Who,' but I find it thoroughly stale and disinteresting when used anywhere else. It seems to always turn into a case of 'we just want to throw a bunch of random stuff together, and so we'll explain it with TIME GATES!' The game doesn't quite go that far - it is decently written - but my not being a fan of the central premise as a storytelling strategy doesn't make me want to award points to the title.  In summary, 'XIII-2 ' really does improve on 'XIII' in certain areas, but it's still more obtuse than it ought to be. Also, it REALLY hits some sour notes with how it wraps itself up. It was good enough to play through, but if 'Final Fantasy' were a band, this would be one of the weakest albums in the catalog.",

            "review_text": "I've completed most of the main Final Fantasy titles: III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, X-2, XII, XIII and now I'm playing this.  Ok, there are my FF player credits. Now I am going to 'rant' more about this game in-detail.     STORY/ART STYLE  I wasn't a big fan of the thirteenth instalment in the series. That said, in retrospective, I think I actually like it story-wise more than XIII-2. Why? Because of the time travel element! The wisdom I once heard: 'Usually, when a time travel plot element is involved, it tells that the story writers were desperate.' That seems to be the case in some parts of the story.  While the story seems much clearer so far in the game, initially, when you first start, the concept of time traveling seems to do nothing but confuse with all the feeling-based concusions about the future and the past. You are given a simple goal: get from point A to point B, and the 'road' to there is all tangled up. Sort of.  Remember FFX-2? It was supposed (?) to be a direct sequel, sure. However, it was a whole different game! There's sort of a stigma associated with direct sequels to Final Fantasy games and it sure made my expectations lower for this 'direct sequel', too.   The plot? with all the 'kupo! look-at-me-i'm-so-cute' and some painfully slow and outright boring parts aside, I have so far enjoyed the idea of finding Lightning and untangling the tangles. I think I will finish the game (once).   I'm not very fond of the violin-piano-la-la-la-remember-my heart-la-la-female vocalist faintly singing type of a thing, as it seems very 'girly' or overly romanticized and overused in the universe of FFXIII. I do, however, like few of the battle themes and how the track intensifies when monsters appear on the field.   The characters? We see three kind of character behaviour in this game: 1) Characters state the obvious. and do it again. 2) Characters don't know a thing 3) Characters (Serah infamously so) become quantum scientists; they pull wild, speculated theories out of the thin air that turn out to be truth.  Usually in the following pattern: 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 3 -1 - 1 -1 -1   GAMEPLAY  Without a doubt, combat and leveling up are my salt and butter in this game. Just like in FFXIII, I find it satisfactory to level up the crystarium and watching the stats go higher. I like the paradigm system as it makes it possible to 'stagger' the otherwise ridiculously strong opponents and beat them up with the right set of paradigms.  I am not entirely satisfied with few things:  Mog throwing? ugh. A nice idea, but the implementation is not quite there.  Mog clock? In few places of the game, the enemies 'chase' you and the mog clock turns red. The problem here is, the enemies are no where to be seen! This means, you are forced into combat with no retry option. How convenient.   The gameplay really drags the story in some parts. Some dungeon hallways are so narrow that you are practically forced to fight battles every few meters. The same things with fast and aggressive enemies in some dungeons. Luckily, the dungeons seem short, which seems to balance this out a little.  Performance issues: the game seems to lag here and there and the gameplay seems capped at 30fps for the most of it. I am running the game on a decent 'gaming' rig:  i5 3570k @ 4ghz gtx 970 4gb 12 gb ddr3 ram  The performance definitely could be better. At 1080P 8x AA, The graphics card barely gets a challenge. Seems like this game is more CPU intensive.And by no means my cpu is a slouch.  Long story short: I'm glad I bought it on sale!   I SAY DO IT! + If you're a final fantasy fan (not hardcore level) like me and out of curiosity want to play through the game at least once + you liked FFXIII + If you are a hardcore ff fan   I SAY NO WAY IN H*** - If you are new to the series - if you haven't completed FFXIII prior to playing this   7/10 story so far 8.5/10 battle system ",

Good: - Attention to detail with the plot, which makes a lot of efforts to appear coherent and is a lot more memorable than the one from XIII (  which is basically a lenghty ultra linear quest which made no sense and lead nowhere  ). Of course, it's a time paradox based story so you'll find as many plot holes as you want to, but I'd say the writers watched a lot of Doctor Who and it looks decent enough to be enjoyed. - The main paradox in the story is just great, with a Doctor Who style resolution. Awesome. - Real choices with corresponding alternate endings which make sense.   And it's a way to escape your doom if you understand the problems with what the main characters are doing ...   - The two main characters are annoying and mean good but don't really know what they are doing. Clever. Lightning on the other hand is the best character from the XIII series by far, and they found a nice way to keep her busy while making her look good. - Good combat system, slightly improved from XIII. - The way the side content is blended with the main story (you have to do side missions at some points in the story, explore timelines a bit randomly, etc). - Lots of side timelines and additional missions. - Lots of content.  Bad: - Could use a few more locations and one or two major paradox plots in the main story. - Some important side content is gratuitously hard to find without guides (wild artefacts locations ...). - Too grindy to complete the endgame content. - Confusing character advancement (read guides). - The third character in the party are monsters which can be swapped. Nice, but again too grindy and impossible to use correctly without reading wikis and guides. Although they tried to find something original and it's a decent attempt, a regular character would have been better. - Graphics and textures are a big downgrade from XIII. Less budget (but far better game). - Some technical details.",

The combat system is fairly lax, with you essentially swithing strategies throughout a fight instead of picking individual moves to use (though you do that sometimes as well, especially for boss fights). The game also features a Pokemon esque monster capturing and leveling system, with less emphasis on catch em all and more emphasis on get the strongest.  This isn't a game for the hardcore, meticulously plan and grind rpg fans, but it is a great game to chill out and kill giant monsters through the timeline with a typically wierd JRPG story.

After finally completing the first game, I thought of completing this one just so I can say I've done it and having gotten past Bresha Ruins 005 and starting the next parts I found the game crashing and freezing multiple times. Next to this, the poor graphics for the rain let the game down as well as it's really not pleasing to have white lines falling down the screen pretending to be rain.   Overall, the game is probably alright for those who can deal with a lacking story line and a main character whose intelligence fluctuates frequently in trying to be somewhat flirty and then knowledgable. While the game doesn't live up to the Final Fantasy legacy, it really isn't the worst game out there, and if there is some sort of patch for these new issues then maybe it'll be more playable and comparable to the console versions.",

            "review_text": "To me, it's unfortunate that the string of Final Fantasy games that were released with the main number of XIII are written off as lousy games. Yes, they all have flaws, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy playing them. FF XIII-2 is a prime example of such a game.  When you release a sequel, the game will inevitably be compared to the source material and I'll do such a thing here as well. While I personally enjoyed XIII, it has received its fair share of critizism. The complaints were mainly aimed at the long tutorial sequence, the linear gameplay and the convoluted story. It also had some other issues, such as a long transition time between the first paradigm shift (the battle system in these games) and the sometimes uninteresting or downright annoying characters.  Square seemed to have done something about most complaints with the sequel. For starters, the opening level (playing as Lightning, the protagonist of the first game) is pretty interesting and while the tutorial sequence with Serah (Lightning's little sister) is a bit tedious again, it doesn't drag on for hours to come. Besides that, there are many ways to explore and revisit different regions and they give the player more options to choose from and more routes to follow. This is probably the biggest change compared to its predecessor and it really helps the game.  I myself embrace most of the changes they made compared to the first game. Like I said, I enjoyed XIII, but most annoyances I had with the first game are removed. For instance, it took me about 60 hours to finish XIII and a few sidequests but it took me ANOTHER 65 hours to wrap up every achievement in the game, including having to grind the toughest enemy of the game in the hope of getting an item I needed for every weapon available. It's way less tedious to complete everything in XIII-2, with the chocobo rider and slot machine achievements being the exceptions. Most battles are now avoidable, which is also a step up from XIII. They also improved and simplified the leveling system, sped up the first paradigm shift and gave us the opportunity to use monsters as part of the team.  Another feature they added in this game is the possibility of alternate endings. While some can be found and viewed during your regular playthrough, most can only be seen after beating the final boss. That also brings us to the post-game content. There are many fragments in each world that serve as a sorts of collectibles. Some serve a purpose, for instance opening a portal to a new and unexplored world or timezone. Some are easier to find than others. The alternative endings you view also net you a fragment for that region. With the time map you use to explore the worlds, it's easy to see if you have found every fragment in that world and time zone. What's even more interesting is that you have the power to 'rewind' a certain section of the game, meaning you can go back and play that part of the story as if you had never set foot on the world before. This serves as a fun way to kill time and make sure you have explored every nook and cranny of the game.  The biggest drawback of XIII is the story. While XIII's story was convoluted and complicated if you didn't take the time to read TONS of story-related content in your menu, XIII-2's story is just too simple. Every problem in the world has to do with time paradoxes and time-travel (which is a key part of the gameplay as well) and they can all be resolved by fixing said paradoxes. That's as straightforward as it can get. The game has a really interesting enemy in the form of Caius Ballad, though he's mainly made interesting by some stellar voice acting by Liam O'Brien. The fights with him are especially very epic and the first battle with Caius proves a hefty challenge if you don't level up some more. It's too bad he didn't get as much screen time he deserved.  That being said, the game is still very much enjoyable. If you can look past the obvious plotholes, or timeholes if you will (badun tss), XIII-2 will give you a fun time exploring the wonderful world of Pulse in an abundance of time zones. The music, the graphics and especially the gameplay make for a game I wouldn't mind completing over and over. I hope you'll give it a chance - and enjoy it as much as I did!",
