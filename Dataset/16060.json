            "review_text": "I felt like it's kinda easier than the 'Samantha Swift and the Hidden Roses of Athena'. Especially because of the scanner option change. Now when you click on the name of the item, the scanner shows you not only the shape of it, but it also changes the color to red once you are close to find the item (like a hide and seek, hot and cold child play). I still like the game. Story is very nice and the graphics put a big smile on my face. I must say that in this game you need to be more precise where to click (I got frustrated few times cause I was clicking right at the object and still the game told me that I'm wrong...and my scanner was breaking way more often than in the previous game), so it takes more time to play this game (I don't mind to play it long). You have way more dialogues in this game, you are solving more puzzles and some of them are harder than the ones in 'Hidden Roses of Athena' (especially the Zodiac puzzle, where you have to be very precise). But overall, like I said at the beginning, I felt like it's bit easier game. I totally recommend this game. You don't have to play 'Hidden Roses of Athena' first to understand this one. :) Combo of those two is really nice though. :)",

Good choice if you like hidden object games, but only recommended if on sale and bought in a bundle with the other Samantha Swift game. Rating: 3/5",
