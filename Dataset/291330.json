            "review_text": "Usually don't post reviews but I can't help it. I got this game for free with admittedly high expectations as I had gotten like 3 really good free games in a row. In theory it sounded great. Simple fighting game with a story and full character customization with 80 whole spots to save them in. Well ♥♥♥♥.   First thing is the character customization and everything else looks like crap. All of it. Which is very disappointing because I love making custom characters. I don't doubt that somebody tried, it has a ton of options, but knowing your game looks like that why would you think that I would make 80 characters? And girl fighters are out of the question, they look like dudes regardless of choosing 'female'. Probably why they showed the character creator running at the speed of light in the tutorial. Alright fine, I made my dumb looking character now I get to make him punch things. Except wait, all of these moves look horribly unnatural. Whatever, I guess he's just dumb, It'll probably look better with game play. Except no, again, the graphics are entirely horrible and the bots will spam throughout the entire match. The only way to beat them half of the time is with more spam with the moves you picked that are meaningless anyway. Why? Because you can punch the guy all day and the second he decides he doesnt want to lose, halfway through the fight, his punches that used to barely dent your health bar suddenly obliterate it. I can't say the story was any good either because I don't even know for sure what it is. What I can get from it is overused nonsense that can't decide what genre it wants to be. Angsty sports movie conversation, therefore you have to win the tournament! Random robot battle! Steryotypical Asians doing wise Asian things! Suddenly magic! And also the apocalypse so now screw the tournament, save the world  You can't say I didnt try to play it, I played long enough for my card drops at least, but this is the worst game i've ever played. Ever. No contest except maybe with another free game I recieved around the same time as this one but I guess I can't complain to much because, you know, free. Holy ♥♥♥♥ they want $10 for this? Under no circumstances should this be purchased with real money by anyone",
