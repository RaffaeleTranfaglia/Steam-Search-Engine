            "review_text": "At first, it didn't seem that good but the more I played, the more it felt reminiscent to doom. Both in gameplay and it captured the addictiveness and wonder of doom that I remember having playing when I was a kid. Thev voxel graphics are quite nice, at first they felt a little amatuerish and low budget but grew on me.  I think the worst thing about the game is the sound. The effects are low quality and the music is royalty free, stock music which I don't think matches very well with the game at all. In fact the endless loops of it puts me off to the point of wanting to stop playing.  I think the developer was probably working on it by himself or with a few people, without much budget, hence the library stock music. I'd suggest getting a composer/sound engineer to redo the sound and music to create a better atmosphere.  However, minus the sound, this is a super addictive little game and for OCD people like myself, there are plenty of collectibles, secrets and stuff to unlock (similar system to doom again).",
