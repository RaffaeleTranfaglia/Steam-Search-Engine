You play as the kids, form your party and collect candies and costume parts made of cardborad. When the fight starts you‘re being transformed into your costumes (robot, ninja, knight etc.) and the fight begins. Fight system is generic turn based rpg system but it doesn‘t need to be different. Seriously go and buy it, it‘s really really good game i promise you will fall in love with this little cute gem :)",

First, let's get it out of the way. This game has no voice acting. At all. It's all ambient sounds and SFX. At first it's weird, but it isn't too bad at all. After 20 minutes you forget your expectations and just accept the design choice.  The game is super fun and exudes charm, with the classic Double Fine level of humour and level design.  I spent 7 hours completing the game 100% including all DLC and achievements, and it was very enjoyable, both in story and gameplay, with perfect controller integration.   I was so 'hooked' by the little questhubs that I actually played the entire game in one sitting, and finished the DLC the day after. Very addictive, very fun.  Highly recommended!  Nilesy",

It's a pretty straight forward RPG battle system where you transform into the literally larger-than-life version of your chosen Halloween costume. But the game's world is what you wanted to experience when you were 10 years old. You wanted to BE your costume (which picking was one of the most important decisions you made all year). You wanted life to be very cartoony. Candy was more precious than money.  The game oozes charm. It has child characters that are actually likable, funny, and clever, which is pretty rare in video games. The monsters and villians are pretty funny. Basically, it's just so fun!",

Through the power of the children's imagination, in battle they transform into towering fighters, based on the costume they are currently donning. These fighters include a robot, a ninja, a unicorn, and a giant crab made out of french fries.   The four hub areas feel visually distinct, but the quest types in each zone are very similar. You will find hidden children, bob for apples, knock on doors to 'Trick-or-treat', receiving either a handful of candy or entering into a battle.   The battle system in this game is almost stiflingly simple. Each costume has a basic attack and a special move that can be used every three turns. Attacks and defense are managed through simple quick-time events, and there are no items or resistances to keep track of in battles.  Your parties stats are limited to HP, Attack Power, and Defense. Levelling up increases these stats by a fixed amount. The only character management lies in deciding which costumes to wear, and spending candy to obtain stamps which give various perks in battle. Each character can only equip one stamp at a time, and some are undoubtedly more powerful than others.   Difficulty is very low, especially once you have a full party.",

It's very... Double Fine. I really don't know how they make their games all feel so similar despite them having different mechanics and stories and settings. Art and dialogue, I suppose. Anyway, that's my only negative-ish criticism.  It's a pretty good short RPG, with quick time attacks/dodging similar to the Mario RPGs. It is actually reasonably difficult despite how it might look so if you're buying this for kids, consider that. I like the innovation of having 'random encounters' limited to houses where you're trick or treating. The story is kind of sparse, but manages to touch on some themes of the difficulties of siblinghood. It fits into the game's world organically, so I can appreciate that.",

I don't have anything against rumble itself, but it kept disconnecting my controller everytime it rumbled over and over, until finally the other day I was able to make it stop disconnecting my controller, had to use x360ce and such to do that.

The one thing I struggled with initially was the mechanics during battles; you have to press the specified key at exactly the right time to execute a successful attack or defence which took me a while to get my head around! After a while, though, I found this aspect to be enjoyable and the difficulty curve was just right, I think.

That game is very easy in terms of its turn-based battles, so if you're looking for a challenge, look somewhere else. I do think it works very well as an 'introductory RPG', though, and can be used to teach newcomers to the genre about basic RPG tactics like prioritizing enemies, diversifying your party's classes, making strategic decisions about abilities, and choosing when to use special moves so they will be most effective. A solid game that makes for a fun Halloween night.",

Heres what I have to say,  ++ GREAT humor and storyline, ('Gus from section 5, your wife is worried SICK.' and the kid in a banana suit who said, 'This is a total banana-fest'. LOL. ++ really lovely backgrounds,  ++also you get to choose if you wanna be a girl or boy, which was not what I was expecting when I saw 'your sister does this' and etc.,  The game itself is really short which is a bummer to me. It has four levels, but they're all long in their own way. You have to trick or treat and solve an issue in each level, and you can play hide-and-seek (well its optional actually), and they'll upgrade your trick or treat bags to cuter and cooler things, you can make optional costumes in the game which can have a big effect on your battle; (I'm not a battling kind of person, but this game was fun and cute.) Battle stamps are the best.  The Grubbin's on Ice was really interesting too, its an add on to the game's ending.  I just feel sad its a bit short for me. Just a bit over 8 hours and I've finished it with all with all achivements to boot with no guide. You shouldn't need a guide for this game! It's fun and good like that!",

I couldn't help but be reminded of The Nightmare Before Christmas (you even get to battle as a Jack Skellington-like pumpkin) but less deranged. If you're looking for difficult, intricate gameplay, this isn't your game. It's got a lot of charm, funny dialogue, good feels, nice art style, and it's adorable as ♥♥♥♥.

This game has what you can expect from Double Fine, very funny and well written dialogue, fun combat system and a nice world to explore. The biggest flaw of this game, is it's length and scope. It's a short game. But the 6-8 hours it will take you to complete it, will be fully enjoyed. The story, although quite simplistic, is fun and entertaining. The combat system is very nice, it's a JRPG turn based system with some quick time events thrown in between. When you enter battle, you'll transform into the costume you're wearing, so if you're using a cardboard robot costume, in battle you turn into a full laser shooting robot. The game has a lot of costumes and all of them very different from each other so you'll have to consider what costumes are best for each character and each situation. To add even more diversity, you have battle stamps to collect and use. These give some additional passive abilities, and make a lot of difference in combat. The game has a very simple level system and currency (candy). You can use candy to buy some upgrades and stamps to further develop your character. All in all, this is a very good bur short RPG, and I recommend it to everyone who likes the genre.",

It's a very, very simplistic game, with choose a button and some QTE stuff. The costumes change things a bit, but anyone who has played any RPG type games at all can probably figure out the two damage dealers, one healer, or one tank, one damage, one healer, and not ever really need to switch costumes, besides to look at the different attacks.  It's not a bad game for kids at all. The writing is still decent, and some of the jokes were amusing, but as an adult fan of Doublefine who purchased it for myself, I feel let down. It's also a very short game. Again, one that would more appeal to a kid audience.  There IS a market for more adult-based Halloween costume style games out there that don't need horror or sex.

It's really a shame that EA and LucasArts are such inept pieces of ♥♥♥♥ that they didn't capitalize on Double Fine during this period and allow them creative freedoms or the sequel to this would have came out much earlier and a Psychonauts sequel might actually exist.

That'll limit it's utility as a fun scary story for younger kids. Oh well.

Okay, the game isn't perfect (if some of the costumes have any use beyong unlocking that 21st achievement, I haven't stumble across it; they simply feel bad in combat), and is more adventure than RPG length.

It's a pretty standard but minimal RPG: every encounter is planned, there are no truly random encounters, there is no way to grind and there are few real choices, except finding out what costumes and battle stamps work best together. But there are all kinds of neat stuff, such as the trick-or-treating aspect and all the cute themed side quests like bobbing for apples and trading cards with other kids. The dialogue and the whimsy are its strong suit. I loved finding out what costumes would look like in battle and what their special abilities would be. I personally loved the collecting candy aspect. I could pail-bash as many garbage cans as they put in front of me!

The game isn't really hard, but if you don't have a good team set up, it can be easy to lose. Even if you lose, there is no penalty or anything of that sort, which is sort of nice.

            "review_text": "Costume Quest is a game about capitalism and the futility of fighting the system. You play as Wren or Reynold, fraternal twins locked into a system in which happiness is always kept at arm's length. Your twin, the object of your worldly fulfillment, is taken from you, and you are forced to incorporate yourself into the capitalist consumer machine in order to free them from bondage - i.e. willfully enslaving yourself even deeper in order to cast off perceived oppression.   The erstwhile heroes are indoctrinated into consumerism through perceived need. Costumes and battle stamps are tools by which they can defeat their perceived oppressors, and candy and creepy treats are the currency by which they can obtain them. The creepy treats only award a special costume upon completing a full set, forcing the consumer-hero to seek out other members of their in-group to trade with and developing a reliance upon victimizing the out-group in order to obtain more. The same is true for candy, but on a much larger scale: widescale destruction and abuse of natural resources is encouraged, and upon reentering a zone the supply magically replenishes itself. Candy is ultimately spent on battle stamps, an entirely extraneous commodity that the game can be won without, but is marketed as invaluable and a means by which to constantly sink the children's personal supply of wealth.  The true capitalist hero of this story is Sadie, a brave young entrepeneur with a monopoly on the battle stamps market who is happy to aid the heroes in their fight against the villainous 'monsters.' She allows her customers to develop a dependence upon her product before beginning to dramatically ramp up the price to obtain newer and better versions of the same - designed obselescence at its finest. By the end of the game the player is lucky if they have several hundred pieces of candy in their bucket, while Sadie sits on thousands that the player spent to constantly upgrade their battle stamps. The 'monsters' of the game are cast as villains bent on hoarding all the world's candy for themselves, when in reality they are collecting it in order to save their own lives. Sadie, on the other hand, is motivated purely by profit - lying, expanding, and price-gouging to drive it ever higher.  The harsh reality is that this game is designed to indoctrinate the player into heedlessly reaping the world's resources and victimizing their competition in the name of achieving fulfillment. They are taught to at the same time fear and trust the two heads of the capitalist serpent, sybomically mirrored by the twin heads of the Doublefine logo: the Repugians, who are the face of foreign investments, and Sadie, the friendly face who is always there to help.   10/10 illuminati confirmed.",

            "review_text": "Costume Quest and it's sequel are colorful rpgs, with the usual mechanics. Press - here and such. However, they also have a sense of humor (And as always humor is subjective) The games are generally fun to play, the writing is funny, but there are a few reundancies in the script, as well as some sloppy writing. But that will only bother you a little (Or not at all if you're not a person particularly attached to grammar, and spelling. (I didn't notice any spelling issues)) The designs of the costumes, and of the in-fight character designs are pretty cool, though out of battle the costumes' design is more cute than anything else. The control scheme is a little difficult compared to console versions, but not so much so that it ruins the game. (Unless you have bad arthritis, than get a controller.) I got these games for a two for one sale for a dollar ninety-nine. Frankly, I think that this is terrible. These games aren't bargain bin garbage, they truly are worth playing.  Mechanics: Pretty much the usual, costumes offer new methods of traversal. -+  Graphics: Cartoony, but generally this improves the game. +  Story: Written with humor, and generally enjoyable. Although, there were times where the script could've been refined, I quite enjoyed the story as a whole. +  Gameplay: It was quite fun to play, maybe a little tedious if you can't find all of the houses, but this didn't bother me. + (That said this is the second game I ever fully completed, more commonly phrased as one hundred percenting)  Controls: A little difficult to use, compared to console versions, but this doesn't ruin the game. And you could always get a controller. -  Miscellaneous: The game was cute. But not overly cutesy, so you would have to punch a bear to get your manhood back after playing it.",

            "review_text": "I bought this game as it was made by the same group that helped with the Day of The Tentacle Reboot. Whether you should buy it or not kind of depends on what you're after. If you're wanting a mature in-depth game with vast arrays of landscapes, character development and difficulty this is NOT the game for you. This game is more of a kooky sweet family-friendly game to pass time with.  I'm a bit of a completionist and so I found this a fun simple game for completing the cute quests and unlocking the different outfits- it's not particularly difficult/complex but it can keep you engaged for a good 5-15 hours. I'd recommend it for when it's on sale at about $5-$10 as a cute game to whittle some time away with- but it's not something I'd want to pay $15+ for (as there are other more in-depth engaging titles for around that price instead).  People have complained that it involves childish jokes; however, to me it was no more childish than some of the original Dragon Quest games and so if you can put up with some of those jokes you can easily put up with (or even appreciate) these ones.  I found the premises of the game (go door knocking at houses, fight monsters, collect candy, unlock outfits to progress further through), unique enough. It is somewhat repetitive, however I feel that they've balanced this by making the game a short one with three parts taking place in three different areas. To me the game length is perfect - you wouldn't want it to be much longer as you'd get bored of the lack of variety but it has enough different elements to keep you entertained for the length of the game. I'm someone who really likes playing side-quests and mini-games so I appreciated the card collecting, bobbing for apples, finding the hidden children quests, etc they had. And I appreciated playing Grubbins on Ice as whilst you could see it was made off of the same kind of gameplay ideas it was different enough to keep my interest.  I thought the battle graphics were endearingly sweet- although it does involve turn based combat and unskippable animations which may frustrate some players. So- if family friendly games aren't your thing I'd recommend skipping this game. If you're after something short, sweet, unique and like mini-games then this might be the game for you.  But if you're really not sure if it's your kind of game maybe watch a bit of a playthrough or a few cut scenes on the community board. I did like this game, I would recommend it, but I'm also wanting to write this review so that those who wouldn't find it appealing can be more likely to leave it alone and not come here complaining about having 'wasted their money on a kids game'.",
