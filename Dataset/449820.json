            "review_text": "Don't go near this game. Even if it's cheap.  The graphics in this game are the worst I've ever seen. Even at maximum settings they are blurred beyond recognition.  The sound in this game isn't great either. Throughout I can hear the music, yes, but there's also this wierd hissing/humming/screechign sound which sounds like bad audio compression.  The gameplay itself isn't fun. The place is a labyrinth, I get that. That's fine: lots to explore. But you have no map, and each time you 'die' you have to restart the game. This means you have to go through the intro sequence, making you likely to forget where you were in the first place anyway.  The controls aren't great either. A lot of the time any of the controls other than A and D feel unresponsive.  As far as the story goes, the whole SCP thing is fine, but this game doesn't really add much to it. You have some of the contained objects that you can encounter and so on, but it doesn't really feel any more impressive than just reading text about them on the SCP wiki.  A lot of people talk about 'bad joke' games on steam. This goes beyond even that.",
