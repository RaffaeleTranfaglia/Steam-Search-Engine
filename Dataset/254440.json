They frequent all of the forum and community hub sites and update when needed. They really do care about their product and want to make it the best sim on the market and to my opinion they have succeeded. This game is a really 'must have' for the serious and not so serious pool gamer. Cheap and twice the price but well worth looking into...buy this game!",

            "review_text": "Pool Nation is one of the most polished indie games of 2013- the animations are shiny and smooth, the gameplay is responsive and the physics are realistic. You won't find yourself screaming at this game for bouncing your balls in the wrong direction, or glitching out and dropping your cue ball through the table. With eleven game modes including tournaments, online play, and single-player endurance mode; as well as a slew of collectables to unlock, Pool Nation has no shortage of goodies to keep gameplay fresh.  The single player component revolves primarily around tournaments where you take on AI challengers of ever increasing difficulty. Each match has an associated list of challenges, and completing them unlocks a variety of cosmetic changes like cues and balls. Standard games like 9 ball are present along with more interesting options like Golf, which challenges you to put specific balls into specific pockets. There’s also a time attack style mode, where balls spawn on the table and you have to sink as many as possible in the time limit. There are Free Play, Versus, and Online modes present too, but I had a hard time finding anyone to challenge online.  Pool Nation is a great looking game that features bright and shiny graphics that makes each game, literally, feel new and different. There are some good themes on the game's soundtrack, and though the game's controls look difficult to use, they aren't difficult to learn. There are also options that can be easily turned on or off to give players assists in a game including arrows that point at the next balls that need to be hit or arrows that show where a ball will travel when hit. All of these features combine to make an excellent presentation for Pool Nation.   But is it fun? In short stints I definitely enjoyed playing the game, but it isn’t the type of thing I’d want to play for hours at a time. Having said that, I think Pool Nation is the kind of experience that would be a hit at a house party. If you’ve been searching far and wide for a Billiards simulator, and don’t have room for an actual table, Pool Nation is probably the solution. The physics are solid, the controls allow for extreme fine tuning of shots, and everything looks super shiny. A few more game types would be welcome, but for $10 Pool Nation is the gold standard in the category.         Pool Nation - Gameplay Demo&nbsp;",

            "review_text": "Hey guys, thanks for reading my reviews. Let me make this as plain as possible. If you like pool and can find this cheap, check it out. It's not bad at all. I think the controls are better here in many ways than I've seen in previous PC pool games, but what's the game really like? You get nine ball, eight ball, and a few mini-games. There is a trick mode that hasn't been put into the game yet apparently. The humor is painful mostly, but not always bad. Just never very clever or subtle.  As for the negative stuff: I think it gets repetitious. It's also buggy. I don't like the AI at all, as it sometimes seems too transparent what's happening in the game. Some of the rounds a really good AI player will goof several times in a row to give me a chance to beat it. Other times it feels like it's cheating to win. Sometimes the match challenges don't appear to count properly or are too literally applied, and it seems inconsistant with its application of what meets the requirements of a given challenge. For example, I played a match that wanted me to get a 3 ball streak with a jump shot. I got a 4 ball streak with a jump at the end and it didn't count it. The next time I played, it seemed to count it. So I just don't trust the AI at all. Also, some of the designer ball sets that you can unlock confuse me visually because the stripes and solids look too similar to me from a distance. The settings are very colorful, which isn't necessarily bad, but can be VERY loud.   Anyway, even though this seems a negative review, it's not meant to be. The devs say they are working to improve it, and if they do I think it has a lot of potential. As it is, if you can get it for a very low price and you like pool, try it. I've enjoyed playing it, but it can be frustrating at times.",

            "review_text": "First off, this is the best looking pool game I have ever played. Period. Beautiful pool tables, balls, and environments that are fully fleshed out and animated to give you a real sense of immersion.  The game is full of details that kept surprising me. Some of them are so subtle that you can't even notice it unless you are watching the replay. Here are a few things you will find:  * 3rd dimension: this isn't a simple pool game where balls stick to the table. All pool balls can be knocked off, up in the air, and over other balls (given enough force). * When hit certain ways, chalk will fall off stick and sprinkle on the table. * Tiny woven texture on table material when you zoom in close * Sides of table (bumpers) actually give and bend in when a ball hits them with force (very hard to notice without replay!)  For single player there is enough to keep you busy for awhile with tournaments in various game types against different AI. One thing I found keeping my interest is bonuses you can try for on each game in a tournament. For instance one might have a bonus for pulling off a jump shot during the match. You can still win the game, but there will be a bonus for doing the jump shot. Earning these stars while winning makes for a fun challenge. There are also many ball styles, cue sticks, and locations to unlock through single player. So far every ball set I have unlocked has been great looking and is a good incentive to keep playing and unlock more.  For multiplayer, it is fully functional in both same computer and online play. Unsurprisingly you have to wait awhile for a game to show up, but that's less the fault of the game and more of the popularity of online pool :).  Last I should go over the physics. This is a tough point to argue because so many factors go into pool physics and without a doubt there is no game out there that is 100% accurate. If you have ever seen a ball hit another ball at high speed in close up slow motion you'll see what I mean. Not to mention there are many different ball sizes/weight, table materials and cue sticks used in different areas that add to the difficulty in comparing this to the real world.  All I can say for sure is the physics seem real and have been really fun. Added to the ability to hit the ball just where I want at power levels I never could in RL the game makes you feel like a pool master.  Game is on sale for $1.99 currently. Sell a couple summer trading cards and pick it up!",

The Box of Tricks mode isn't in as of this writing but it should be availible soon. It's a great game to play if you just want to chill out, turn off the music and listen to music of your own.",

Each match can give you 1-3 stars. Usually you get 1 star by winning match which also unlocks next match and then other stars you get when doing certain task during the match (you still need to win the match also)  Tasks like: Perform comboshot during match or kickshot or get streak of 7 balls in match + much of other stuff like that.  Also getting 2 stars in certain matches will unlock bonus match in that tour. Each tour contain few bonus match to unlock.  I have completed first 9-ball tour by 71% and it took me 6 hours, so if other tours take as much time it means total 48h of gameplay and still you havent compeleted everything by 100%, so this game has plenty of nice singleplayer content for your money.

Back in the 00's (yes, I'm that old), I used to love Virtual Pool 3 (which I can't get to run on any platform now), and, after a drought of many years, this has filled the void. I'd change a couple of things, mainly that you could lock your X-axis when your shooting (but this is mitigated by the 'fine-tune' key) and I change the power meter thing to a mouse-mapped power (a-la VP3) but apart from that, it's a great pool game. I'd have to put a shout out for the artwork two, the stylised characters and their back stories is awesome (and it does it all without slam zooms and star wipes)e. If you've got a hint of imagination, you don't feel like you're playing against some artifically levelled AI (even though you are). Well done Cherry Pop (now fix the X-axis lock *claps hands* make it so!)  Oh, one other thing, the menu system is horrible, could really do with an overhaul.

The ability to play on your own in the lobby while waiting for friends to connect is one example of a small feature that makes a world of difference.

For some, that may be off putting, but it's not too far from reality, a lot of top players will clear almost any table if theyre having a good day.  Only issue i have really is that after a while, it gets kinda dull. Caning each AI player one after the other gets too easy after a while, and the only way to lose is to try and get 3 stars for the 3 challenges per match, but providing they don't ask you to do something that actually requires any thought, like a bank or kick shot, you have no excuse not to get all 3 stars.  They also try and spice it up with bonus matches of different disciplines of pool, which again is cool for a while, I still haven't mastered them all.   I don't really know what to suggest to make it better, it's pretty much as good as I can imagine a pool game getting, barring adding some kind of trick shot challenge, but then again, you may aswell make all shots a trick shot once you're used to the game.   8/10 - A very good time killer",

I think I was only...what, five years old during the time?  In any case, the controls took some getting used to, but after about 10 minutes into playing '9 Ball', everything felt natural.  The camera angles give a nice sense of realism, and if adjusted correctly, you feel as if you're holding the pool stick yourself and hitting the target...with psychic eyes in seeing guidelines.  The physics in this game felt just right for me, where like real pool, speed and precision matter when banking shots, as well as how you plan to hit the ball, such as curving and hopping.  The graphics added a nice sense of realism to the game, and the crisp clear look on each ball gave the game a nice type of brilliance. The only thing I question is that every ball has a reflection, which is very awkward to me, since I know actual billiard balls aren't that reflective in real life. But I'm being anal at that point, and you might as well add scratches to the balls and pool table, and make the atmosphere bleak.

With that said the pyhsics in the game seem good, you can actually do some pretty neat trick shots if you know what your doing.  All in all, unless your really into Billards you will not find $10 of value here, its a good game to pick up if you like billards with fairly realistic physics when it is on sale, but I can not recommend it for people who only like Billards at full price, not because the game is bad in anyway but because well a video game version of pool no matter how good it is is still a somewhat niche market. So if you find it on sale and can pick it up for $3-5, even if you only like pool I would say its worth it. If your really into pool, then even $10 is worth it, but don't come expecting anything other then a competent pool game with good physics because apart from unlocking new table skins, ball skins, and stick skins its 'tournaments' might as well just be single match games because even if you loose to someone you can just retry them.  Just as a warning I did have the game crash on me once when doing a trick shot, so it may not be fully stable, but enjoyable Billard game non the less.",

This lead to completing stars up to four times before the game successfully registered them. Another frustrating but not game breaking issue was that the overhead view became blocked on some levels which left me with only the on table view. This view is enough to play on, but still limited my options. A lot of little things like this detracted from the game for me and lead to me sending it to the done pile earlier than it should have been.
