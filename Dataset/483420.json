            "review_text": "There is no denying this is a very well put together HO style game. Instead of the usual 'mostly static locations you move about and click on things with a few puzzles' what you get is much more like an interactive cinematic experience (with some HO and other puzzles thrown in).  The reason for the -ve rating is mostly value for money. I completed the 1st episode in under 80mins, without skipping any of the cutscenes. There were two, maybe three HOPs, and only one other puzzle which took more than a few seconds to solve.  So while it's very well crafted, I feel it's way too short. Especially as there are some pretty decent HO games out there with far more content and replay value, despite the (slightly) less glossy presentation. The whole series (4 planned episodes atm) may well be better than any of the other HO games out there at the moment. But will cost at least four times as much. And I don't feel the extra gloss is worth it. If anything, it actually detracts from the puzzle-solving aspects.  If what you want is a well presented interactive story (which is very standard 'supernatural dectective' fare) this is almost certainly for you. If you want puzzles and good value casual gameplay; then probably less so.",

It was pretty much easy but I was hooked to the story anyway and I wanted to see what's next. I'm sure the other chapters will have the same quality. Strongly recommended.",

I love the mini games, the dialog and the cut scenes. There is a creative approach to the HOPs that make them even more fun. It is smartly written, sarcastic at times and exciting. I wish there were 10 episodes! I recommend this game for sure and look forward to the next Mad Head Games production!",
