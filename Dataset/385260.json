Also this game have great voice acting and a really cool feeling of an old retro rpg game. This game has many great possibilities but I haven't heard of anything else. Anyway I recommend it for EVERYONE!!!!!   *it isn't hard*",

I loved the choice between turn based combat and a more action type combat, which was done rather well in my opinion. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fun 30ish mins to kill.",

            "review_text": "While Lamia Must Die is a good game, and a good concept, the story itself is lacking. Where's the gameplay between the intro and the boss battle? And the turn system makes it hard to come up with a strategy. Plus Lamia is a bit OP'd in this game. Adding gameplay between the intro and the battle with Lamia would have helped the party gather strength to face her. On top of that, I can't see the top part of Lamia, or the characters when I pull a super on her. That needs to be fixed.  However, on a good point, the voice acting is spot-on, showing the characters' emotions. I played as Ursula and she came off as one of those characters who tries to find sympathy for the antagonist in a hope to change her. However, she does come to her senses and realises that Lamia cannot be redeemed. I also like that the assassin character is vengeful in her quest, the priest is a good healer, and the Paladin has a good sense of justice. So the redeeming points lie mainly in the characters. And kudos to Lamia's voice acting, which gives a daemonic vibe.  I give this game a 5/10. Good, but still has a ways to go, and could use some improvements. My recommendation rating remains neutral.",

Despite the fact that the game literally throws the player into the action with a complex UI (especially, for those who never touched RPG Maker in their lives), and no explanation of the items; this short game has quality voice-acting, creative skills and cutscenes, and creative ways of using the default engine. Overall, you'll probably won't like the game, but I'd still suggest you give it a go. If you use any RPG Maker, this is a must-play game for it's sheer creativity alone, I give it a 6.5/10.",
