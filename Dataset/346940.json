The UI in particular has been optimized and is far more open. I personally love the asian styling in the art and music. However, Hong Kong is still the same game as Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall. If you loved those games then this is defintiely for you. If you didn't like them, you should probably look elsewhere. I have heard some complaints about the story in the long term, but I have not delved deep enough to confirm.   Pros -More expansive backgrounds -Better Atmosphere (Sounds and Art) -Much Better UI -Animated Scenes (Soemthing like cutscenes but shorter) -Writing -More Polished art (Cyberware finally shows up on the character model) -Polished Visuals -Much better Matrix  Cons -Some technical bugs -No tutorials for hacking (I had no clue what I was doing and I tripped the alarm)  This is a polished version of the Shadowrun Returns experience. If you liked those then you will love this.",

            "review_text": "Unlike the other Shadow Run games, Hong Kong falls short on several avenues. In this iteration, only two of the five characters have their back stories flushed out, with personal missions garnering comparable intrigue to the main story line. That said, the main story line was not terribly interesting; however, the final chapter did have an appropriate climax and resolution.  The engagements in the Matrix have changed dramatically and you will either love or hate the change. Personally, some changes such as the password component associated with firewalls is an interesting addition. Also the ability to disconnect from interface at any time is a nice change. A less welcome change is the addition of the frogger sequence where you need to dodge the path of the security programs.  While the main story line and personal stories of some of the characters are lacking, the brief interactions you have with NPC's in the world are short but very interesting.  Mission and gear: There don't seem to be very many missions. I think there were maybe 10 missions before the final chapter?  There are some additions in terms of weapons but, in my playthrough at least, there were no special armors with attribute/skill bonuses - only cosmetic differences.  Overall, the game, the story, and the changes are quite disappointing.  If you're desperate for a new shadow run game, I would save your money until the game goes on sale.",

            "review_text": "For some reason I slept on Hong Kong for a while, which is odd considering  I loved Dragonfall  and thought it showed growth in leaps and bounds from Harebrained Scheme's  initial effort with Shadowrun Returns .  I really wish I hadn't. I'm enjoying this one nearly as much as I did Dragonfall.  There are some minor differences, but most of what I described in my Dragonfall review remains the same here. I'm a big fan of story-driven RPGs, I love good characterization (though who doesn't), and I'm a massive fan of good tactical RPGs (I count Final Fantasy Tactics among one of my top-5 favorite games of all-time). This is another solid entry in the series with more good writing, great art design, a fantastic score, and deep turn-based tactical combat. If you liked Dragonfall, then buy this game. You'll love it. And if you haven't played Dragonfall, feel free to give them both a shot.  For the rest of the review I'll talk about some minor differences between this and Dragonfall and how the two games stack up.  First, and perhaps most notable: The Matrix has been greatly expanded upon. It's no longer just a separate tactical combat portion mostly mirroring combat in the normal game. It now features a stealth aspect and more puzzle-solving. The visual aspect of the Matrix has also been greatly augmented. It has more of its own feel now, something I didn't realize the series needed until I played this game. Rather than just the regular game with lots of translucent blue, it now exhibits some incredibly foreign feeling background visuals along with odd lighting and blocky, jutting architecture. The dev team clearly put some time into rounding out decking, which I appreciated because I typically play a weaponless Decker/Rigger player character. There's an added stealth element which I'm not a huge fan of as it promotes too much of a trial-and-error, save scumming style of play since it's simply too expensive to go all-out as a Decker and always roll in with your own ESPs and programs. And once you've alerted the system too much, it's simply too difficult to always fight unless you're spending your Karma and money on nothing but Decking points and gear. I spent lots of time saving before the Matrix, quicksaving during runs, reloading when I got caught and continuously trying to get through fighting only where I needed to. If I went through and just played it as-is, I would always end up getting caught too frequently, leading to system-wide alarm, and then getting my face stomped in by enemy Deckers and IC. I literally didn't succeed  once  in these situations, and that's with spending the vast majority of my earnings just on Decking gear. In my experience it's simply not possible to get through the Decking sections successfully without save scumming, and that's a huge problem indicating that the balance is off. The movement is too imprecise to really nail the stealth sequences (which leads to a lot of frustration) and once you set off the alarm, the response is almost always too difficult to simply fight through unless you're loaded up with programs and ESPs. That leads to you being forced either to save scum or simply failing and getting knocked out of the Matrix. You have to be insanely lucky to succeed otherwise. It all boils down to the fact that the Matrix sections rely too much on a stealth element that is too imprecise to be relied upon. So I'm not wholly on board with the Matrix redesign as my frustrations with this game almost always occurred there, but I do like that they're making an attempt to flesh it out a bit more, as there's a lot of potential there.  Thankfully the 'meatspace' combat doesn't reflect the imbalance of the Matrix gameplay. It's challenging without feeling cheap, and unlike Matrix combat it's approachable from many different strategies. Great tactical gameplay.  As far as the general non-combat gameplay is concerned, I have to issue a warning here: There's a  lot  of text here, and a lot of reading. This game is a classic cRPG at heart, and if you're not ready to read through tons of dialogue then you probably won't like this game. The way I play (speaking with everyone and constantly exploring every nook and cranny) led to about a 90% to 10% split between dialogue/exploration and combat. That means I spent about 90% of the game walking around and talking to people. It's that extreme.  That would be a bad thing if the writing wasn't so good. The story is more personal than Dragonfall, and less sprawling and epic. That's not necessarily a bad thing; it gives the characters more room to maneuver amongst each other, and some of their interactions are more heartfelt than in Dragonfall. I'm not sure I'd call one better than the other. They're just different, but the character writing here is equally as good as Dragonfall and the plot drives forward briskly without leaving you feeling too bogged down in hub areas.  Seriously, these characters are fantastic. Some of the NPCs in the main hub area are  so  likeable. Shoutout in particular to Ten-Armed Ambrose who runs the cybergear shop. But the entire game is chock full of well-written, interesting character -- Just like Dragonfall was.  One thing that  is  notably better is Jon Everist's score. Anyone familiar with my reviews know that I'm a big fan of good OSTs in games, and Everist has noticeably stepped up his game from Dragonfall, which had a great score in its own right. The tracks here are less obtrusive; they're more ambient in general and do more to craft the feel of the game's world while at the same time adding touches of traditional Chinese music. Combat themes and the more fast-paced pieces are electrifying as well. I'm incredibly excited at the direction the Indie scene is taking game scores. Jon Everist, Austin Wintory, Darren Korb, etc. These are all great talents that are adding massive value to small-budget games. I can't wait to see more of what they craft in the future.  If I have one complaint about the game it's probably regarding the interface. Clicking action nodes to talk with people or examine something in the environment is sometimes problematic. The nodes disappear, or they register a misclick when you're clearly clicking on them. The karma interface is improved from Dragonfall but the overall interface still leaves a lot to be desired. Why can't I see drone HP? Why can't I see my Decker's HP while he's in the Matrix? Don't show me a health bar, that's not exact enough. It doesn't do anything to help educate me so I can make decisions on what my next moves are. Just small things like that. A minor complaint, really, but still enough to comment on.  If you like tactical RPGs like the old Tactics Ogre series, Disgaea, or the XCOM revival, then this game should be an instant purchase for you. It's fantastic. However if you find those types of games to be too slow I'd stay away from this one unless you're in the mood to grind through gameplay you dislike just to experience an immersive story filled with genuine, interesting characters.",

The main storyline feels a bit forced upon the characters, but that's not particularly different from the previous installations (the Seattle and Berlin stories).   Very good improvement on Matrix exploration; overall, the missions seem less about world-saving and more about trying to get by. Would definitely recommend to RPG lovers.   For those who don't know about the Shadowrun setting -- it's a cyberpunk world with magic, mostly, in the dark setting of 80's Gibson cyberpunk, with megacorporations controlling the world, and shadowy protagonists trying to survive while getting entangled in stories much larger than themselves. Good writing, although sometimes predictable.",

            "review_text": "Making a recommendation for Shadowrun HK is a pretty straightforward thing: Did you enjoy the previous Shadowruns by Harebrained? Then you'll most likely enjoy this one as well. While it isn't as much of a clear case of a pure upgrade and improvement like with Dragonfall and the first official campaign SR:HK added enough small changes and toys so that you have some stuff to experiment with while keeping most of their tried and true formula intact. It uses the combat system of Dragonfall Director's Cut and also has the customizable perk systems for your fellow runners which was also introduced in Dragonfall DC which is a very nice addition.  Some of the completely new stuff include new spells, some changes to older spells, new more varied drones like sniper and auto fire variants, new decking rigs, a new cyber affinity skill for chrome and mostly more chrome itself, especially cyber weapons like cyber claws or a cyber leash. The matrix segments also got overhauled, it offers more visual variations but the biggest change is that you can sneak around and crack firewalls with a minigame in order to avoid combat in the matrix almost completely if you wish. If you don't you can just let seekers spot you until defender drones spawn which makes the matrix pretty much play out like in the previous shadowruns. The sneaking in the matrix is frankly extremely clunky but the option to avoid fights is a very welcome one and even if you trigger the alarm the fights aren't as grindy/boring as in the previous games' matrix sections. Another change which I really liked is that in general you have a lot more opportunities to use non combat skills and quick thinking to avoid a lot of fights, a lot more so than in previous instalments. Which is not only nice for roleplaying reasons but it also is very handy in situations where you would be kinda under-equipped and the fight pretty darn difficult.  The story/mission structure hasn't really changed, you eventually end up in an hub area from which you launch your missions, and you're mostly free to chose which mission to tackle next. Your fellow Runners are a pretty interesting bunch again with entertaining/interesting dialogues between missions even though I have to say that some tended to be a bit less memorable than in Dragonfall. I feel that especially with Is0bel they could have done more - while her personal quest was very enjoyable the hub interactions with her felt rather bare bones. Props for the other companions though. Another nice touch is that you get a chance to have a small conversation with each mercenary runner you can hire. Similar to what Dragonfall DC did with Lucky Strike just a bit less detailed but for all mercenary runners.  The plot itself is arguably more simple than Drgaonfall but personally I feel that Hong Kong has the best atmosphere of the Shadorun games yet which is saying something because I always enjoyed the setting and its atmosphere a lot. The music is spot on and helps to reinforce the atmosphere and the cutscenes and writing further cement it. And the basic point remains that I very much enjoy the setting of Shadowrun, its cyberpunk and its bleak dystopian world and HK does a good job of bringing the setting to life yet again.  In conclusion it's easy to recomment Shadowrun HK to fans of the series, the only real flaws I can think of is that the pure plot is rather simple if that is very important too you - or that if you feel like you've grown bored of the previous games' formula then this game prolly doesn't add enough new things for you to to shake things up. Otherwise I really enjoyed the game, especially that you have more dimplomatic/non-combat opportunities than ever. But most importantly for me I absolutely adored the atmosphere of the game and the mystery of it. It's gonna be interesting to see how a replay feels after the mystery has been lifted - I guess we'll see soon enough ;)",

They're trying too hard for ram-rodding-this-story, and I often felt rail-roaded by the 'decisions' and especially the tactical-cool-trick missions ( some of which are just infuriatingly game/immersion-breaking ).  I still love what HBS did with Shadowrun, but the earlier games felt more like the classic RPG with lots of good dialogue, character arcs and SR atmospherics. This one, actually, just feels really phoned in.  I expected more, I guess. The 'cool' Hong Kong setting is just another piece of the pie being shoved down your throat. Just, no.

            "review_text": "Having completed S:HK, I figure it was time to share Wot I Think about the game.  Game Length: About 12-13 hours and that included every mission I found but one.  It's easy to start this review. If someone liked the other games, they'll probably like this one. It has the same music style. Same art style. Same character leveling. Same skills. Same gameplay. It's basically the same game with a different story. As such, you could easily call this a new DLC adventure of Shadowrun: Dragonfall. So that's the basic recommendation - if you like the others, you should buy this. I did and I enjoyed it. Somewhat...and that's the kicker.  I'm not nearly as happy with this game as with the past games and I know why:  Empty Derivative Disjointed PCs and NPCs The Matrix   Empty: Tthe maps appear to be bigger. They're lovingly created and visually appealing. I've always loved the art style in this game. But they often feel empty and underutilized. There's very little compelling content that rewards you from straying the least little bit from your course. There are no quests off the beaten path, no interesing rabbit holes to fall down into.  Derivative: The game and story are entirely derivative. It's impossible to play this and not feel like you've played this before multiple times. FAs I said above, it's bascially the same game with a different story. But even the story isn't all that different - you run into a problem, watch someone get killed in the opening adventure, end up working for a broker who feeds you jobs, interact with the same computer terminal, do the jobs and finally advance the story. It's Dragonfall's premise all over again.   Disjointed: Unlike Dragonfall, where the above quest-system made great sense, this is a wasted opporutunity. Instead of nibbling around the main plot line by facing some weird incidents to build tension towards the final climax, you're off on entirely unrelated missions that aren't all that interesting. As I said, this made sense in Dragonfall because you had to make bank to advance the plot line. Here, they're just something to do for a while. So the plot is very disjointed. You go to the Walled City early and then never again until the final battle. The plot about dear old Dad isn't all that interesting and doesn't even make all that much sen sense. The denouement attempts to explain it, but by that time it's far too late. Missing Dad is just a plot device and an illogical one at that. So the missions and the mission structure are a massively WASTED opportunity to bring a more cohesive adventure to the story.  PCs and NPCs: The ghoul was a nice touch. The others...forgettable. Your brother? Annoying. The NPCs here really took a step back and weren't all that interesting. And there's still no control of their leveling. The specials are an attempt to give you some control, but frankly they're not all that great or that useful. I'd much rather have the ability to shape my party the way I saw fit. And it didn't help that my character - a sword-wielding street Samurai - happened to be the same exact type as the only interesting NPC out there. As for the player character, I didn't see how any of their responses would have changed the story much if at all (with the exception of keeping the vampire girl alive). In short, the PC doesn't matter except to be the wall that everything bounces off. When will HBS learn that the best stories often have the PC to go through a journey and not just move through the story without impactng it?   The Matrix: The gameplay in the matrix is still incredibly annoying. Even more this time with their 'Simon Says' hacking game and the overall detection meter. It's not fun and it's not interesting at all. It sucks. I finally started using the deathray cheat to make it through these parts. And at times you simply can not avoid it. It's terrible and HBS should entirely dump the systems and start over there because they're making it worse, not better.   Again, it's not that it's a bad game. I'll give it a thumbs up review. But as for Kickstarting the next one in this series or buying it at full price? I'd have to see some genuine advancement in gameplay, strategy and story telling before ponying up dough again because I feel like I'm playing the same game over and over again - especially when this version isn't as good as the last one.   Verdict: A tepid thumbs up. Very tepid.",

            "review_text": "==== Pros: ====  Environment - Probably the single, hands down, best part of the game. Screenshots just don't do it justice. Everything from the detailed clutter on computer desks to the trash floating in the water. The clean environments look sterile without looking empty and the dirty environments look grimy without masking detail with dirt. It creates a fun environment to play in and I never get bored. Even the 'hub' areas retain their interest.  Characters - They all have personalities and in a role playing game that is essential.  Text - There is plenty of text to read. This might be a con for some but there are plenty of emails to sift through and people to chat up.  Replay - The game makes you want to play it again to try new characters. I was not able to purchase every weapon, every armor, and every implant that I wanted in a single play-through. Even with companion characters displaying their abilities I still have an appetite to play a different character type.  Humor - The game lets you choose a lot of different dialogue options and there are a good deal of humorous ones.  ============== Not a pro, not a con: ==============  Dialogue choices - A lot of times your choices don't have any meaning but there are a small handful of times where they do.  Save system - It is good that you can save in the middle of a fight, there is a quick save, and there is an auto-save. I really wish I could name my saved games so that if I choose to go back way earlier I can have a better idea of why I saved.  Matrix - The concept is cool and I really like that you can be jacked into the matrix during a fight and running simultaneous battles of hacking with gunfights. The combat seems a bit odd in the matrix. I had a very high level decker and I never ran into issues where I felt challenged in combat (aside from maybe once early on) but for some reason I missed a lot in combat. It just dragged on the matrix combat needlessly...them missing, me missing...next round.  Story -   I liked that they added an eastern influence to the game by using feng shui and qi as a key element in the storyline but I felt that the overall story concept was overused. Prosperity reminded me of the Mako Reactor idea from Final Fantasy 7.    ==== Cons: ====  Bugs - There are a lot of small bugs in the game like armor not updating until after you load an area, continuity errors in dialogue, the main menu buttons will sometimes disappear when you go back to the main menu after saving and exiting, some sounds will stop playing if the game is left on for too long, etc.  Voice acting - there is none with the exception of a guy talking at the beginning and ending of the game.  Music - It is decent but there is not enough variety. They put a lot of effort into the way the environment looks but there is not much to listen to.  Interactivity - The game is full of these great environments with tons of detail and most of the rooms are empty without even a magnifying glass (icon used to indicate 'search' which gives you text info about an area).  Unbalanced Fights - Some fights in the early missions are harder than the final mission encounters. I'm sure that could be explained by character progression or player experience early on versus late game but in reality there are just stronger opponents with better weapons and more waves of enemies. The final fight in the main storyline was easy compared to some of the side missions.",

The missions are more varied and have a unique narrative and mechanical twists to them. Your crew of runners are the most varied bunch so far, although unlike Dragonfall, they're almost always on your side with no sense of winning anyone over (which makes sense in HK's story).  The only two issues I've had so far have been the redesigned Matrix (which is real-time stealth until you trigger an encounter). It's clunky, frustrating and bugs out if you enter the Matrix in the middle of real-world combat. The other issue are the bugs themselves, and rather than gamebreaking ones, there are many moments where dialog seems to bug out, is lost, or doesn't properly advance (not for the main missions, rather side stuff like NPCs in your hub or optional dialogs in missions).  Shadowrun still manages to pull off the closest atmosphere to a pen-and-paper RPG among modern games, setting the stage so well and not having its lower production values get in the way. And the devs still manage to deliver a very satisfying ending each time, even after three games.",

I may have made a bad decision in terms of deciding on which missions to take on first, but there is no indication that it would be super chatty mission vs one that actually has fighting in it. In fact, I don't even know for sure if missions with less dialogue and more action (of some variety, e.g. fighting, matrix runs, puzzle/problem solving objectives...) even exist.  The backstory of the characters is not particularly interesting, either. The case of characters are cool in overall concept but are kinda bland overall. You're supposed to even care about your foster father's disappearance, but the game does not even get you to 'care' about this seemingly random person. So why would I care about finding him? It's just like that with most of the characters...there are moments of vulnerability but there's no real depth yet, no conflict among team members, or anything even close to what the last two iterations have done in terms of building strong, memorable and lovable personalities.  I like that they beefed up the weaponry, the Matrix changes, and carrying some upgrades from SRDF:DC with the character development.  I'm going to keep trying to push this on, but I sincerely hope it picks up or I will never finish this game. The story is extremely boring so far and I've played for 16+ hrs now.

            "review_text": "Game type -- Shadowrun's unusual setting (cyberpunk mixed with fantasy elements; entirely possible for a cybernetically augmented pistolero to be magically hasted by a shaman while dealing with hostile abominations from the astral plane) set in Hong Kong rather than Seattle. Stats-based RPG, heavy emphasis on small-squad tactical combat, fixed-perspective isometric view, mostly-linear campaigns w/ a small number of non-random side missions available. If you've played either previous Shadowrun Returns game, this will be pretty familiar territory for the most part. Strictly single-player.   Played through main and bonus campaign w/ an elf pistol-specialist street samurai with a fair side investment in charisma; typically had a rifle samurai, a decker, and a shaman in the party. Don't expect to build a character who's good at everything and wielding the best of everything as resources can be fairly tight and this isn't a game with repeatable quests to farm (in the included campaigns, anyway; UGC can be as generous as the author feels like).   Positives incl. -- true to setting (for a CRPG, anyway; can't really replicate a human GM's ability to incorporate and handle all the wacky ideas a player might have, so your options will always be limited), combines some tongue-in-cheek humor with a cast of suitably shady characters, revamped Matrix system (but can rely on a particular NPC decker if you don't build your player character as one) favoring stealth and timing, often multiple approaches to getting to the next stage. Charisma isn't a complete dump stat, and knowledge of the right etiquettes can give you opportunities. Still, do not expect to be able to avoid all bloodshed by any means; you will need to kill, and frequently.   Mixed -- There's Workshop support, but there seems to have been less modding done for it (notably few story UGC) than for Dragonfall or first SR iteration. Combat mechanics are improved over original SR/Dragonfall with cover and positioning matter more, but it's still fairly light -- if you want a game where you can shoot an enemy on the floor above you through the ceilng or collapse a staircase with explosives, this isn't it. You won't have to spend twenty minutes per turn meticulously planning, however, as if it's some hardcore complex military simulation with a gazillion things that you *could* do where many of 'em will eventually doom you from wasting too much time or too many resources or getting too many limbs removed from IEDs you didn't spot. Complexity is a matter of taste.   Negatives -- pretty short game (main and extended don't take all THAT long to play through once), story isn't anything to write home about over the long run. One can also argue that it's not terribly innovative over Dragonfall, aside from the revamped Matrix sections. There's also one bit of cyberware that's fairly sketchy, because once it shows up (and it shows up pretty frequently in the bonus campaign) grenades are drastically less useful, and that removes options from the board.",

As ever, the writing by Hare Brained is what makes this game. I said after Dragonfall that if they never changed the engine, graphics, technical stuff and kept the same high level of story and writing then I'd keep buying and that is exactly what they have done (and me). I'll not give any spoliers away but no character ever seemed so real to me as Ractor, sooo well written. If you like Shadowrun, good stories, plots, characters and dialogue then get this game.  I just remembered, there were a lot of chances to talk your way through instead of fighting through (xp is given for completing missions, regardless of 'kills'). This is such a rarity in games these days.  Hare Brained, Please please please keep making more of these high quality Shadowrun games. Oh yeah, I'll give it a 10/10 if you want a score rather than just my rambling comments :)",

            "review_text": "Shadowrun: Hong Kong is a continuation of the Harebrained Schemes series of stories taking place in the Shadowrun universe. The predecessor, Dragonfall (Directors' Cut) was a gem in RPG-gaming and improved upon the original success. In spite of being a rather small developer, HBS has had some success in this series of games which is the reason why this is their third kickstarted game.   Shadowrun: Hong Kong starts on a story arc which is separate from the previous games, so you do not have to play those to get into this series, however if you are unfamiliar with this games series there are some precautions you should have to consider:  1. The game has a lot of text in it 2. While story-driven, there is no way to play it without entering many firefights and combat situations 3. It has bugs  The first point is definitely something to consider for the modern gamer, almost all dialogue is written text without speech, just like in the old days of gaming. The advantage of course being that there are a lot of dialogue and interaction in the game which immerses you, with well-written sequences that create a lot of atmosphere. If you like to read, then this will be a pleasant experience - but if you don't have the patience for it, the game will be frustrating.  The second point is rather frustrating for a role player, while you will meet characters that are prone to combat that will aid you, there simply is no easy way to say this: You will have to fight. If you don't like combat, Shadowrun isn't for you. Shadowrunners are essentially mercenaries hired to do mostly combat runs. You will be able to gain advantages through dialogue and hacking and such, but there is no way to complete this game without long tactical combat scenes.  And to the last, third, and possibly MOST aggravating issue with the game, its bugs. HBS has made three games and all of them suffer from similar bugs. Some of which completely block you off from doing certain areas because there is a problem with some trigger, or because of a general 'combat won't end'-bug. On top of this there are glitches where certain weapons won't show, and it looks like your character is shooting an air rifle (á la air guitar) and other things (like noxious clouds being immensely overpowered in the final chapter of the game). In some cases you can't do anything but reload the game and take a different route, in other cases you can try and press escape, and resume the game, click wildly, press tab, and sometimes you will be able to get back to 'normality'. This is a rather huge caveat though, HBS has many bugs from the original game still in their code. This is simply sloppy. I backed the game, and now am hesitant to do it again due to lack of playtesting and bugfixing.   Shadowrun: Hong Kong is still a very much enjoyable RPG-experience that gives you many decisions and options that tread the grey areas of morality and sometimes delving into complete chaos and amorality. The storyline is well written without going cliché on you, and manages to surprise you at times. For the prize, it is a very enjoyable game, but in spite of playing it through the weekend I felt it was short, and that interesting characters could have had more development, and that some scenarios could have been fleshed out more - add the bugs on top of this and it is a flawed gem, but still a gem indeed.",

I am 15 hours into the game and would be surprised if I have spent &lt; 10 of those 15 hours reading essentially static text boxes of dialogue that have virtually no impact on the characters, world, or gameplay.  There's an old saying in the film and TV industry: 'Show. Don't Tell.' Essentially this is saying that it's incredibly lazy and boring to just sit there and explain the plot and character motivations to the viewer. In film and TV (and games), you have the advantage of a medium that can _show_ the users what is going on, and let the viewers immerse themselves and figure out what to feel on their own--SO USE IT. In games, I'd even go one step further and update the saying to be: 'Play. Don't Tell _or_ Show.'  Regardless, this game fails the 'Show. Don't Tell.' rule worse than any game I've ever ever played.  The sad thing is that the writing is excellent in my opinion. I would consider reading this if it were an actual novel. But I bought this to be immersed in a _game_, not to spend countless hours reading to periodically get a 30 minute break to, you know, finally do something semi-interactive...",

It's a good game if you're a fan of the series, but this is really a buggy affair, no way around this. Expect a lot of replaying, specially the last few missions, so SAVE often because you will do some backtracking.  The interface is glitchy and buggy, animations are stuttery and click capture laughable at best, here a better job could've definitely been done.  OTOH, the game looks gorgeously hand drawn throughout, and it's still Shadowrun as far as creating a new build and playing through its countless missions.  I did enjoy the fact that the game has become longer, so there's a lot of time for fighting and developing your character throughout, as well as enjoying the process of learning how to fit in the team and make the best out of every possible roster member you decide to bring along. The strategic aspects of the game are impeccable as always and just a blast.  Lastly, the matrix engine was 'ok-ish' for the first play-through, but just taxing and not fun second time around. I guess I won't be doing any more experimenting on this one because I don't want to have to go through all the hacking sections, they've become long and boring fillers between otherwise good missions.  SR:DF blows this one out of the water, so if you haven't played that one, do yourself a favor and go for it. If you have and crave a bit of SR fun, go for this one knowing that there still are too many bugs all over this one, but that the storyline and strategic bits are great.

The game played a lot like its previous iterations, from a game design point of view, and the graphical upgrades to the Matrix are pretty neat but not as exciting, it feels like they didnt put too much effort on it as they should have. The new puzzle system (for hacking) in the Matrix killed it for me, the whole simon-sez / Memory game wasn't well laid out and was boring. In general the game was good... But not exciting good.  The story itself was interesting at some points but it felt more like the campaign someone back in my highschool days would coin up to play on a saturday afternoon. It was good but not $30 - $20 good. There were a lot of flaws in the writing, like I said it was very bland and forgettable and not well thought out specially at the beginning. A good word to describe it would have been... Meh.  Whatever upgrade they did with the graphics engine is pretty neat. The artwork in the game is pretty good, it feels almost like being on a painting. If it were not for the artwork I don't think I would have been compelled to play the game so much if it wasnt because the graphics were that pretty.  The so-called Matrix update artwork-wise was really good, I liked the new representation of it. I still think at Char-Gen you should be able to pick an avatar for your character instead of the floating generic one, as it doesnt make you feel part of the game just another random icon to be a part of. The Gameplay in the Matrix was horrible. I understand the need to put a mechanic for the 'hacking' part of the game but playing Simon-Sez with the numbers is not it... Then that memory game to figure the codes was also pretty stupid and boring. They should have randomized the mini-games in the Matrix at least...   The other thing was you couldn't upgrade in any way any of your companions, you can 'Level' them but its very bland and un-intrusive and pretty insignificant, but you can't add cyber to them or change their weapons or spells.  The overall gameplay was pretty much the same as in the other games of the series. But the whole interaction felt like a point-and-click story than an RPG and overall the game was too short. By the time you got the cash to up your gear the game was over. The game feels more like an expansion to the original game than anything else... Dragonfall had a much more bigger impact on me as a player than this game overall. I was really expecting a lot more for the time the developers took to build this game. It feels incomplete and rushed, from the sense that the story even with the side stories and the 'team' stories were interesting, but it felt rushed.  I wish tha game had been longer, had some more depth and had a better story. But Shadowrun is one of my favorite Cyberpunk pen and paper RPG, and until Cyberpunk 2077 hits the streets it is what it is...   As a conclusion, I think of this game as an expansion-DLC type. I wish they re-made the previous games with the engine and graphic optimization they did on this game, and have them all under one engine... But I think the game could have been better, for the time they took to make it. I think it was very cool they added the portraits of some of the backers in areas of the game, it was a nice touch of gratitude.  Overall the game is a 7/10 in my book. The game took me about 26hrs of compressed time, with all the side stories, companion stories and fiddle-farting-around. Started playing it Friday afternoon and finished it Sunday evening.  I am going to give it a couple of weeks, and play the game again as a streeet samurai rather than a decker to see other aspects of the game, but I dont think i am going to see a whole lot different than I have seen so far.",

            "review_text": "Shadowrun Hong Kong is the 3rd entry in the Shadowrun RPG series. In it, you play as shadowrunners, criminals for hire. The core gameplay is the same, with XCOM gun and tactical mechanics set in a cyberpunk with magic historical fiction universe. You have companions to talk to and multiple paths in each quest, as well as in the narrative in a larger sense. You can let your morals affect the game and role play in a few distinct ways. Everything pre-2000ish in the real world happened in the Shadowrun world, except in 2012 an event cause elves and dwarves and dragons (and other things, like the emergence of magic).  Overall it's an excellent but buggy game. It has some problems. I think the AI is only decent at the highest difficulty, for one. There isn't much in the way of side activities or anything like that, but there is some downtime if you choose to talk to people and run around the hub the game is based in. They do have lots of interesting dialog. It evolves with each quest you do, and in this one I've noticed that the number of quests you do will make people start to respect you and treat you like you're some kind of a badass, which you really are in this game. Companions also have a quest of their own. They're not the most interesting, but Racter definitely makes up for the others. They're all fine, no one really grating on the squad except for maybe the person who's supposed to be your foster brother. That's not a spoiler, it's the first thing you learn upon starting a new campaign.  The good parts are when you're generally kicking ♥♥♥ in a not too tedious scenario where there's something enjoyable happening. That's a lot of the game. One bad part is this cyber world called 'The Matrix,' which you have to enter with your hacker character multiple times in order to access information, unlock doors, etc. The Matrix gameplay is kind of like that of the normal game, except it includes this bizarre stealth puzzle aspect to it which doesn't fit at all with the way the movement in the game works. Another problem is that there is just not quite enough money for some expensive specs, and the game is also not extremely well balanced with regard to certain character builds.  I also hate that these games have a tendency to be a little ham handed with the messages towards the end, and the dialog can sometimes reflect this. I still think this game is much better written than something like Pillars of Eternity, which does nothing but exposition for the first ten hours in all its character interactions. There's less writing than those essays in Pillars, and each character definitely feels like an actual character.   One real criticism is that the game could be said to be easy for veterans of RPG's, but I feel this way about most titles in the genre. What I mean is that any RPG fan will know from experience that not checking out every possibility during a quest will often mean you have to make a much harder choice than if you carefully investigate the entire level to find just what you need. So if a choice is either blow up the bridge to save yourself or fight a horde of enemies, there will always be something you'll find which will enable you to both blow up the bridge AND not fight the enemies, and all it takes is just looking around the area a bit. It's not like there's so many things a player can interact with, so you'll get to them all if you have a modicum of patience.  The other thing is again the bugs. There's tons of bugs, none entirely game breaking but two bugs (an inventory related bug and a bug for finishing a quest) made me restart the game at least once. There are some armors and hair styles that do not mix, with the hair clipping through the armor in a way that really can feel like nails on a chalkboard to see so often. This is also a game with yet another weird issue, where there's like one thing in the game that is time sensitive and it's not the most important thing, but everything else can generally just wait. I don't like games putting time pressure on you when there really is no effect. You're left guessing if the game actually wants you to hurry or not, and that's increidbly annoying. I don't care how contrived a reason you think of, but make it so you convey to me that I don't actually have to rush to get somewhere before I can't do it anymore.  Compared to Dragonfall, I thought Dragonfall had the better story and setting. Hong Kong isn't as compelling as the anarchy in Berlin was. The unity of the town in Berlin is missed. Here there's some of that but it feels different. All these games are about finding some person when stripped down, and I felt the least connection to the person in this game than either of the other two games.  So yeah, it's a great game, fun solid combat and good stories with some occasional hiccups. The bugs aren't the worst thing but you'll notice far more than you want to. Still, that's not enough to really make me not want to play, nor should it be that way for you.",

After playing Shadowrun Returns and then Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut, I was eager to begin this third installment in the SR series. The main attractions for me have been the story and role playing elements that tie in to the deeper lore of the Shadowrun Universe.  To begin with, the production quality is much higher than the previous two games. There is more content: more missions, more dialogue, more characters, more game mechanics, more items, etc. If you are a completionist you will definetly get more bang out of your buck from Hong Kong. At the same time the quality of the content has improved, the artwork for each setting is much more detailed, event triggered transitional music has been added and voiced cinematics now compliment the main storyline.  Of course there have been several quality of life improvements (that others have described thoroughly enough), as well as still existing bugs, such as disappearing items given to team members at the end of each run. Then there's the new Matrix system, an odd combination of playing 'hide and seek' and taking a quick IQ test. While I took it as a welcome change, I admit it's one of those things you probably either love or hate. Either way, you will end up dealing with it to finish the game since the punishment for bruteforcing your way through the matrix can be too severe during some missions. Even if you build a tough matrix Decker, fighting the ICs will make you waste rounds against time limited objectives and you might end up failing the mission.  If you're like me, however, and you spend time talking to every character, reading every Shadowlands post, probably overthinking your dialogue options, etc. then you can probably overlook everything else and focus on the story.  Oh the story! It's difficult to make any real criticism without spoiling any of it so here is my conclusion instead. I've read several of the other reviews comparing HK's story with the previous ones, claiming that one is better than the other, and while I understand why they might feel this way I will argue that HK's story is as good as Dead Man's Switch or Dragonfall. Even if I liked Dragonfall's story better.  I believe it's due to a combination of personal and cultural bias. Having grown within Western culture, it's far easier for me to relate to Seattle and Berlin than to Hong Kong. For as much as I wanted to suspend disbelief (and believe me I did, I even researched the history of Kowloon City between game sessions), concepts used such as Qi and Feng Shui felt too foreign to me. I understand what they are meant to be and their basis on real world concepts, however, they are simply not part of my world. I guess I'm too UCAS for this, chummers.  Both stories use the same major elements typical of Shadowrun. You're a fringe member of society, surviving as a criminal mercenary, and get caught into a plot bigger than yourself. Both integrate fantasy and technology as major plot elements. Both have twists and turns. Both contain moral and philosophical dilemmas. Both include individual character development storylines for your team members. And yet there's one critical difference between them, Dragonfall is set in Berlin while the other in Hong Kong.  While I might favor DF's story over HK due to this, you might relate better to these concepts than I do. And I encourage anyone who might feel hesistant about getting this, due to the quality of the story, to give it a chance.  Shadowrun: Hong Kong is a clear improvement in the series. If you want to make this your first Shadowrun then I'd recommend waiting for a sale. The Shadowrun series is rather unique and with Dragonfall having most of the features from Hong Kong, at a fraction of the price, it would make a better entry point for someone new.",

            "review_text": "After the awesomeness that was Dragonfall, Hong Kong really feels like a poor attempt at achieving the same glory and failing badly.  Systems wise, the game is the best in the series. The Matrix has been revamped, perhaps not entirely sucessfully, but it feels more dangerous and more exciting than the old Matrix system did where you were essentially a hacker god no matter what kind of deck you ran. Cyberware has been greatly expanded, allowing you to build a very cool street sam. Companions are now actually useful and can more than hold their own in combat, which means that your character finally does not have to focus so much attention on being able to kill everything in sight just to pick up the slack from your crappy team members. The missions seem to have more varied goals and other solutions, and take you through a nicely varied set of set pieces and some beautiful scenery. A lot of the fights in game can be bypassed through use of varied skills and etiquettes, and there are multiple outcomes to a lot of the scenarios. All of the NPCs also seem to have a bit more to say, so if you like reading a lot of lore and exposition, you'll be happy here. All of this is great. (The one sad thing is that Mages and Adepts are really still just kind of terrible, adepts especially. Why they can't come up with a way to make Mages as dangerous and powerful as they are in the PnP game is beyond me. It can't be THAT hard to put a 'drain' system into the unity engine, can it? Your mage is still just casting Haste and Aim on your street sams over and over again to be useful.)  Yet the problem with Hong Kong is its story. Throughout the entire game, it commits the most deadly of movie/game sins, in that it doesn't follow the 'Show me, don't tell me' rule. The story is about this one particular neighborhood (called the Walled City) in Hong Kong that is, in essence, being cursed. People keep telling you how god awful it is in there, how lives are worth nothing, how there's this palpable aura of despair and misery in the entire area, etc etc etc.  Well, great. Why should I care? You see, the game TELLS you all of this, but never actually SHOWS it to you. One of your earliest missions is to go into the Walled City on some minor Yakuza run, and the worst thing you see is that some punk steals an old man's credstick. Oh noes! (It's even more pathetic than it sounds, because you can actually get the punk to give the credstick back.) And that's it. Other than that it looks like a few random streets. And then you never, ever go back there other than for the final mission. So again, why do I care about this place? It's certainly not Chicago. Where are the missions that show me just how terrible everything is? Where is the dark, morally ambiguous run that makes me SEE just what a hellhole it really is? Something in the Walled City is giving you and everyone else nightmares, but those nightmares are just small snippets of text and stuff told to you by NPCs. Again, SHOW ME, don't TELL ME.  (There's some attempt to get you to care about the Walled City because of Random NPC Who Dies Or Maybe He Didn't Die Who Is Important To You, who is tied in some weird way to the area but that's just a crappy style of writing that has never worked before in any game of any kind, and it doesn't work here either. At all. I couldn't give two craps what happens to 'Raymond' nor why he was trying to enter the Walled City.)  This premise is simply not capable of carrying the story, yet it is being asked to do so. It's at most good enough for a side mission, not for the plot of an entire game. I kept waiting for the actual story to get going, except it never did. You have to do some missions for the Yakuza, I kept waiting for the big twist to hit and the real story to start, and it never does. You do about 10 missions, and then suddenly 'WARNING, YOU'RE ENTERING THE FINAL PART OF THE STORY!'  Really? This is it? This is literally what the whole story is about? A slum that your character has never heard of and doesn't give two sheets about? What if I'm playing a morally corrupt Shadowrunner. Why would said shadowrunner even bother? I'd just get on the next boat out of town.  The best way to illustrate how bad it is is in the main antagonist: Where in Dragonfall the entire time you're planning to go up against a freaking Great Dragon that had all of Germany wetting itself daily, in Hong Kong for the longest time your big adversary is: A guy with a plastic mask. Seriously, that's it. He's even called Plastic Face Man. It's like the game is deliberately trolling you at this point. Then when you meet him, he's even more pathetic than you already imagined him to be. The KE security squad that comes to his rescue is a far bigger threat than he himself is.   (To be fair, the actual big bad is revealed after that, but still, it doesn't exactly make for a 'tip of your seat' experience. And the real big bad is essentially the boogy man from a children's story, so I found it kind of hard to even be worried about that.)  The whole thing just feels like a set of (some very good) missions strung together while the devs just couldn't really come up with any way to make them into an over arching story. It was honestly quite boring, story wise.  Still, the missions are good, the systems work smoothly, combat is fun, your companions are good, you can find some cool ways around problems, so if you ignore all the whining about the Walled City and just scroll through it quickly, you can still have a good time here.  All in all, I'd say that if you enjoyed the previous two shadowruns, you'll enjoy this as well, but it's really the weakest of the three. Maybe pick it up on sale at some point. I'll give it a thumbs up because the systems have been smoothed out, and because I'd hate for this to be the last one that HareBrained makes, but just be warned that it if you're expecting Dragonfall 2, you're not going to get it. Not by a long way. I really hope they'll take another shot at it in the future.",

However, Hong Kong does not deliver and we need to be honest about it. I am not sure what changed in the development of this game, but the final result feels rushed and unfinished.   The first alarm kicked off as soon as I began reading the text. Namely, right from the start I began noticing errors, missing words and letters, to the point that it seems like nobody bothered to run this through a simple 'Word' spell checker. Now, you might be thinking that this is nothing more than nitpicking, but the dialogues in general are horribly written. Most characters in the game seem to talk for no other reason than to make the game feel longer and they bring nothing of value to the table. This comes from a person who loves to read and I am a huge fan of games that do not shy away from text, but the problem with Hong Kong is that the text is just boring and bland. If the quality of the text was on the level of Planescape Torment or even Shadowrun: Dragonfall, I would love this game - but unfortunately it is not!  I mean, when the local blacksmith greets me with 3 pages of text describing how he is sharpening a sword and where he learned the craft, the game is just wasting my time. I have not learned anything of value about that blacksmith, I have not learned anything about his character, I have not received a quest, I have not learned anything about the setting or the story, I have not received a piece of valuable information... it was all just a big waste of my time. And this wouldn't be such a problem if it wasn't a regular occurence for almost every character in the game. After playing Hong Kong for 15 hours, you notice that 70% of the game is just reading these hollow meaningless walls of text.  It almost feels like there was more content planned, but that the devs ran out of development time. Makes me really sad, because I actually loved the general direction of the story. Hopefully they are planning to release a Director's Cut which will iron out all the bugs, flesh out the characters and rewrite the dialogues so that they actually lead to something.

They have the nerve to have another kickstarter campaigns after the first game, while still using the exact same engine and a good ~50-65% of the same assets, all the while not fixing what is wrong or broken with it? Hell, this game is more buggy than the other two combined, and selling an 'Extended Edition' and still selling a buggy product absolutely can not be defended. Unlike some of the other reviewers here, I liked the change they did to Decking (At least, half of it--I actually like the minigame that comes with it, even if it was poorly explained, the stealth bit is terrible though.) And I was hoping there would be new cyberware options, which I loved (And will love, if it continues to be expanded.) But as far as I can tell, thats the only real difference between this version of their engine and the previous one. They also nerfed the ♥♥♥♥ out of SMG's, for pretty much no reason at all, two of the new Cyberware's completely breaks the weapon balance in this game (Thought Rifles were OP enough as it is? Don't worry, you don't have to use AP to reload them anymore! Grenades a problem for you? Just use magnet hands to toss them right on back!) Mages/Shamans are still weak, they actually nerfed Haste, which was one of the better Shaman spells available. While I liked the new Cyberware, and you actually have a way to get a little bit more essence now, the new Cyberweapons are still questionable--one of the melee options is clearly superior of the other in every way, while not being anymore expensive, you don't have the option to start with the only ranged Cyberweapon available to you (The Monofilament Whip) which sucks if you aren't a melee build, and only one of them still functions as an unarmed weapon.  If you can get beyond the shady business practices and the terrible engine, you'll have a fun game that will have you entertained for hours, but I certainly know that if they repeat this -again- I'm not buying another Shadowrun game.",

This game takes the same engine and goes crazy-go-nuts. Two or three times as many enemies, large maps, vendors on combat maps, complicated mechanics, and teams of helpful NPCs make the game go really weird.  I've had the game repeatedly take a long time 'thinking' about turns for enemies I had not aggroed, so the long turns just resulted in them taking no action. I've had friendly NPCs block exit doors and I had to trick them into fighting enemies so I could get past them. I've had both enemies and friendly NPCs take weird turns where they just kind of wander around the map. It seems like whenever enemies summon a spirit, it inevitably starts wrecking them and they don't fight back against it (yay!). I've had really weird item management when vendors are present on combat/mission maps.

I label this game as 'Less of the same.' It's the same core game as all the others, but the story just seems so much more less.

Did I enjoy the game? Only in the way that FF7 geeks 'enjoyed' FF8. The potential is/was there. If only the creators gave a crap and started to make custom content and fix their broken editor. ",

There was a typo in one of the main story conversations, which is completely unacceptable. And there were admittedly few occasions in the previous games where etiquette played a huge role, but when it was used, it mattered. I have had 2 etiquette options so far that basically did nothing, or at least felt like they did nothing. I would say we should do something, they say yea, and then say we need to do that and convince me why as if i hadn't just said that. And lastly, label me a prude, but the other games got along just fine without drop;ping anf F bomb every other word. Scumbags still felt like scumbags then. The swearing is unecessary and really detracts from the game. There is some good, but mostly minor things. The character models are vastly inproved. Cyberware feels like a more important part of the game. But over all it is a poor attempt at continuing the series so many including me have come to adore. I suggest no one makes the mistake i did and buys this game.",

It is a completely different beast than Dead Man's Switch (i.e. Shadowrun Returns) or Dragonfall, which I both loved. When making this game HBS took one step forward and three steps back. Even the 'new and improved' Matrix is hardly an improvement - they didn't make it anymore challenging, they just made it somewhat annoying.   This is by far the worst Shadowrun game that HBS has made. I am quite disappointed. :/  Original Post: It's like Dragonfall but with a higher production value, HBS improved upon almost everything.

What I didn't like: A lot of lag and freezing Dialog is inconsistent - e.g. you can go through 1 tree and find out valuable information, but then go back and start over and go through another tree as if the npc you're talking to never told you this. Also, there are several gramatical errors. New characters seem a bit op. There's never really a reason to RENT runners Enemies run in rooms and immediately shoot at/through crates/cover. AND, you still get shot through full cover boxes Missing when you have a 99% chance to hit. Yes, I understand that COULD be the 1% Game stopping(not breaking) bugs - bounty towards the end. If you force him to give you an item and you don't have a shaman, you cannot exit the dialog. The only thing you can do is close and re-load. Screen doesn't zoom back out from some cut scenes Enemy AI can be pretty bad at times Spoiler Alert...

            "review_text": "Playing Shadowrun: Hong Kong left me feeling somewhat conflicted. Firstly, the writing was great, but that's never been a problem for Harebrained Schemes, generally the dialogue is witty and funny and excellent, even if the 'plotlines' for missions do tend to resemble each other a bit and things go wrong so often it's more of a surprise when things go to plan.  The basic gameplay also wasn't any worse than the original SRR or SR: Dragonfall, with a few noted improvements(decking has been improved somewhat), but it felt like it was just too easy. Playing on Normal, I think I had a total of one challenging battle(mostly because I was lazy) and zero challenging choices or puzzles. It simply felt too hard NOT to do the right thing, I'd have had to be blind and an idiot to screw something up, I never really felt like I had to think, which is a damn shame.  The game also really felt very short. The actual core plotline, which has a very creative premise, consumes about four missions, counting generously... while there's about twice as many side missions. Which is a damn shame, because I wanted to dig more into the actual premise, and I wanted to drag it out a bit so they could actually do something with the atmospheric writing they were getting into, maybe do a bit of horror. Instead the climax they've been setting up consists of about three fights with a short corridor in between each, none of which are as big or challenging as the ones at the end of Dragonfall(...or even really the original SRR). The shortness and lack of fights is also a bit of a shame because the nice level-up system for the companions gets little play as a result, Gobbet had some handy powers for manipulating enemy spirit summons... but I think I had a total of two enemies in the entire game who ever summoned a spirit.  Which, again, is a shame, because I really liked most members of my team(except for Wu and Is0bel, which... is kind of a shame, because he was supposed to be core to the plot, instead he just comes across as kind of dull, and you'll basically always be stuck with Is0bel if you're not a decker yourself, but mostly what she does is complain about how bad her past was) while Racter, Gaichu and Gobbet are all fun to deal with and talk to.  In general, the core plot suffered from a few major issues. Firstly, it was never really given any time to work itself out, it was over too quickly for any impact. Secondly, it was hard to care about Raymond when he was a character you were only told about, basically never met, the game could have done with more flashbacks, or maybe even an intro gameplay segment set BEFORE the current era. Thirdly, as a result of it being hard to care about Raymond, it became hard to care about Wu, because his entire thing is basically just Raymond Raymond Raymond Raymond My Dad Raymond My Dad.  I genuinely dug the side missions, but I can't help but feel that SR:HK would have been better if they scrapped them and put all those missions into the core plot instead.  Still, the writing was fun enough that I don't feel like I wasted my time playing it.  Except for one thing.  WHERE'S MY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GOBBET ROMANCE, YOU NERDS.   OR AT LEAST KU FENG.  BOO.",

[v 3.0.6]  Pros: Better Music Immersive Storyline and environment Slightly more difficult - I'm looking at you Matrix space. Asian theme is a bit cliche but charming all the same.  Cons: Lack of inventory content. Little money, skimpy on the weapons, spells, armor, etc. [I upgraded my weapons once] Tons of dialog but most of the choices all seem to end with the same/similar results. BUGS. BUGS. BUGS. I've experienced several myself, thankfully nothing too game-breaking and I save frequently. As of right now, I see 28 pages on Steam's forums. Load times are long. Regularly experienced 5 second hangs during combat. Hangs/lag during IC hacking are frustrating when remembering/typing the numbers. [i7 processor, Fresh install of Windows 10, nVidia Geforce GTX 560M, 8GB memory, uptodate drivers]   Overall, the game is a slight improvement in originality and story... BUT this product is unfinished.  If testing was an issue, I would glady have playtested portions for free. Much of the fanbase likely feels the same. Not worth the 20$ - wait for it to go on sale or to get its much needed patches.  Rating: 3/5 &amp; Recommended because I like that HBS is keeping this franchise alive.

I gave my mummy summon to Gobbet for one mission and when I finished the mission, it disappeared when I never used. In the previous game, it would ususally just go back to storage. It's a bit wasteful in my opinion that unused consumable end up being wasted instead of being stored.  Another point is the matrix. It's kind of more annoying and I would say an added difficulty. If you are going to incorporate stealth, make it less messy, more cover, and more open so it's easier to manuver. Another thing is the blocker IC hacking. 10 choices plus the keypad makes it more time consuming to do. Maybe reducing the number of choices to 5 or 6 would be better or not include the keypad at all.  Would I recommend this game? Yeah if you like the story and like the increased difficulty.

This review will sound a lot like my Shadowrun:Dragonfall review (in fact I copy/pasted some of it because it's true here, too). The writing is top-notch, I *love* the story, I love the art and atmosphere, I love the universe. The gameplay reminds me of the isometric games of old. The turnbased combat feels solid and has *just* enough tactical weight to feel fun. The characters are amazing and feel like real people. It feels like a real, interesting world. It's like reading a fantastic book.  Once again the decisions feel weighty and meaningful. Even though yes, this is basically a linear set of encounters it doesn't feel that way. It feels like a real world in which I am making real decisions. If you allow it you can really get sucked into the experience.  Additionally, I really love that they are weaving a story across all of their games and that they all intertwine. Yes, they are all in Shadowrun and so you expect part of that but it's really, really cool to hear references to stuff that you did in Berlin (i.e. Dragonfall). Stuff like that makes it feel like hey, this is a real place with real people!  I'll say what I said for Dragonfall: f you like RPGs, if you like cyberpunk, if you like turnbased combat, if you like *amazing* writing, if you like cool 2D art, then you owe it to yourself to pick this up.   This and Shadowrun:Dragonfall are two of the best RPGs I've played in the last 5 years.  Additionally, I'll say again that HBS really supports their games after release. Bugfixes and updates are guaranteed and I also know about an additional mini-campaign that they are doing because their Kickstarter reached a certain goal. You can tell that they really love doing this and it's not solely about money. It feels great to back such a company.  UPDATE 2/13/2016: The bonus campaign is out and it's MEATY.

I played through the game (including Shadows of Hong Kong bonus campaign) on normal using a mage as my main character.  This is a very similar game to Shadowrun: Dragonfall. The setting and the story are obviously new, there's a new decking minigame (which is not that great) and there are a number of minor gameplay refiniments. Otherwise the changes are pretty minimal and the core gameplay is still more or less unchanged.  The main hook here is obviously the story. The writing is generally pretty decent, even if not quite as good as Dragonfall. The setting is fairly interesting as well, even if the futuristic Hong Kong gets a touch too cliché-ridden at times.  The turn-based combat remains passable, even if it is still pretty simplistic and gets repetitive after a while. On a positive note you can avoid a lot of the battles. The overall difficulty felt rather easy this time around and at least the normal difficulty was a complete cakewalk.  The Shadows of Hong Kong bonus campaign is fairly lackluster. The story is rather mundane and even boring and there's too much tedious combat. The mini campaign does provide some additional character development and closure for some of the characters, but frankly it can be skipped without missing much.  If you enjoyed Shadowrun: Dragonfall, Shadowrun: Hong Kong is pretty easy to recommend too. Just keep in mind this entry brings very little new to the table. If you are new to the series you should start with the slightly superior Dragonfall instead. The original Shadowrun: Returns is rather lackluster and can be safely skipped.  The good: - Decent story, even if it's not quite as good as Dragonfall - Interesting setting - Some well-written characters - The Extended Edition felt less buggy than the first two games  The bad: - The turn-based combat is still rather simple and gets repetitive - The new decking minigame is pretty bad - Normal difficulty is too easy (significantly easier than the previous Shadowrun games) - Enemy AI is still terrible - Duncan is an annoying crybaby - Shadows of Hong Hong is a fairly boring addition  The ugly: - Long loading times - Some UI issues",

The runs were so original and creative, making me feel like I was at a buddy's dining room table with my character sheet in front of me, and my dice bag by my side. I also enjoyed the characters, and the setting, in the game, immensely. I could go on about the characterization, but I will pick one and really focus on Kindly Cheng. She was special. Every interaction with her was a treat. One could literally smell the booze and cigarette smoke off of her every time you were called into her mahjong parlour to speak to her. A lot of people go on about Dragonfall being the best and the peak of the series - I don't think so. Dragonfall to me had a lot of very heavy undertones - racism, to name one - it was a lot darker. Also, it did was not as 'mature' in it's design of it's runs. I can really see the maturity in the design of the runs for Hong Kong.  Definite 10/10 rating for me. Easy. ",

They kept the permanent team of companions that you can get to know, including your character’s estranged brother which I thought was a great extra connection to rope you into the story surrounding the two of you from the start. The other members of the team, some of which you pick up on the way, are also interesting, and surprisingly engaging from a text based narrative.   You never really lament the lack of voice acting; the writing really does do the characters, story and the environment justice on its own, as long as you are comfortable reading as much as you have to. As per usual, I’m not a great fan of the hacking mechanic, but I’m notoriously bad as timing myself around three other moving things and not being seen. But that’s just my short comings and not a reflection of the game at all.   The artwork is gorgeous as always, and I’d love some of the street scenes on my wall at home. I’ve always loved Jon Everist’s music and Hong Kong’s soundtrack is no different, it’s beautiful and lends to the setting perfectly. All in all, I can’t find fault with this game that isn’t my own personal preferences, and wouldn’t necessarily bother other players, depending on their own likes and dislikes.  If you haven’t played this, I strongly recommend you do. Whether you buy full price or wait for a sale is entirely up to you, but I don’t think you’d regret it either way to be quite honest.",

            "review_text": "Shadowrun: Hong Kong, the third installement in the Shadowrun reboot. The game is based (just like previous installments) around a protagonist whom gets his/her bum marked as a shadowrunner after bad happenings. Along the way, the player meets new NPCs, gets info around the current predicament and trots around the hub to talk with people or buy items. The game's heavy on dialogue, choices and repercussions, just like in the previous installments.  If you're a fan of Shadowrun, then this is quite an easy pickup. If not, I'd highly suggest to start with Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall.  What I liked about the game is that it's story rich, much like the previous games. The atmosphere is great, the hub area is rather nice to explore. The NPCs are alright, the alternative storylines are alright... And that's sadly it.  There are several NPCs to choose from and have dialogue with. Sadly, aside from 2, they all fall under the 'meh, seen this character before' category. Aside from those 2, I personally didn't care much about their predicament. Sure, some of it was like: Woah, what's going on... But it fell so flat on its ♥♥♥♥, because it later got the 'we've done it, yay' treatment.  The missions that the player can pick up are, for the most part, well done. Some turn into a complete nightmare, but unlike the previous installments, it's not as well worked out this time around. It feels more 'safe' compared to the previous installments. There's only 2 missions where I was generally taken by how things turned out (only to be classified as 'yay, we done did it' in the end) which is a huge letdown.  The focus was probably more on the combat and hacking. The combat is amazing, hands down. It's fluid in nearly every way eventhough it feels a little easy.  The hacking is a lot faster and it feels more down to earth. Yet... Did we really need to get a memory game and then a sequence of markings?  The ending is lackluster. I saw it coming a mile away. Not because this is another installment of Shadowrun, but because the game didn't even try to mask it. I do like that there are several different options, but the general showdown felt weak.  The pacing of this game has to be the most horrible thing I've experienced in the last 2 years though. I felt myself becoming really bored after playing it for a while. You go on a mission which doesn't take 15 minutes, then hang around the hub area for an hour, reading arbitrary dialogues. Then there's the 'role playing' aspect. I'll compare this to Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 4, because this game does the exact same thing. Aside from some decisive factors, 80% of what you say/respond, doesn't even matter. The big choices issue has even broken the game in 1 level, where you can't proceed if you didn't spend the right karma points.  Another reason I couldn't play the game in long runs, is, because it's a dialogue heavy game... With LOADS of typos in it. It doesn't just come down to a letter wrong here and there... There are whole sentences that aren't proper English. There are commas missing, misspelled words littering every conversation, as well as plain lazy writing. As a big fan of Dragonfall, this is a major disapointment. I found myself not caring for some of the dialogue anymore, even when it sort of started to become interesting... (And then it usually dried out right after in most cases).  All in all, even if the review seems mostly negative, because this installment's a huge step down from the previous ones, this is still a pretty enjoyable game. The combat feels good and responsive, the atmosphere is great and it feels like a Shadowrun game. It just lacks what made the previous installments a great game.  I'll not play it again for a while, unless, perhaps, the pacing gets improved and the numerous typos get fixed.  I don't mind a typo here and there, but like I said, the game is riddled with it.  On that note though, the sound and music effects in the game are well done. Some even improved from the previous versions I might add. But I still wonder why my heavy pistol sounds like a dart gun...",

I've fallen out of favor with ranking games on a 1-10 scale, so lemme just give the good points short and sweet: This is a turn based RPG in the Shadowrun universe, and the second standalone expansion. You do not need to play the original or the previous installment to understand this one (though a cursory knowledge of the Shadowrun setting helps.) If you like BioWare games, especially the classes like Baldur's Gate, get this game ASAP. If you like cyberpunk and RPGs, you'll like this game. If you're a fan of later versions of the Shadowrun setting, since this uses an earlier version of rules as its base (and changes those to fit the PC platform) you MAY be put off due to how different it is. It also doesn't have the deepest of combat systems (your party members aren't COMPLETELY customizable, for example) but it's no shallow pool either. While the characters are quite interesting, they also don't gel quite as much as Dragonfall's cast did. Interestingly, YOUR character actually has a history beyond 'knew a guy' this time around. This may not sit well with some people who prefer to project their own stories on their characters. Shadowrun is a rather unique setting. Honestly this game is about even with Dragonfall in terms of quality, so don't be afraid to pick it up if you liked Dragonfall.",

            "review_text": "Awhile ago, HBS releases Shadowrun Returns, something of a love-letter to the RPG aspects of Shadowrun. It featured Jake Armitage of the SNES game, allowed you to do some fun stuff with rigging (robo-puppetry), featured functional decking (hacking), and in general got the atmosphere of the Shadowrun setting right, but was a little awkward in terms of writing towards the endgame.  Soon after, Shadowrun: Dragonfall comes out, and more importantly, it's director's cut (as a free upgrade if you owned Dragonfall already). This made for a near perfect modern cRPG, in my opinion; between the writing, the plot, the music, the character growth, and mechanics, it was an all around stellar title.  Now we come to their third Shadowrun RPG, Shadowrun: Hong Kong. I've little to say about this that I haven't just said about Dragonfall, but let me say that all in all, it feels like a much better game mechanically, if with a slightly weaker story and better level and character design. I'm not sure if it was my just being too enthralled by the damn thing, but it felt much shorter than the thirty hours that I played it for to the end. It greatly improves on its weaker mechanics present in the past two games, even if the hacking minigame is a little tedious. I would have to say my only significant complaints are that the music feels tacked on, maybe even limp or ill-fitting in places, and that there seemed to be a dearth of equipment to be found in the field (unless you're into sniper rifles).   All in all a fantastic title.",

Your crew is cool, the characters are well made. I, for example, never considered hiring mercenary runners, because I very quickly learned to appreciate Gobbet and Is0bel. The artstyle is once again on point, the portraits are fitting and the score definetly fits in. HB also did a good job on building your home district, Heoi. It catches the flair of a cyberpunky/scifiesque chinatown slum, but you still get to feel at home there. The gameplay is not too different from Dragonfall, but I already liked it back then. If you are into isometric RPGs with turn-based combat, you will feel comfortable here and love the huge amount of possibilities this game offers.  The story. It's not a bad story. I got pretty absorbed. But it is really straightforward imo. You have the main continuing main quest which progresses really fast and aside from that, only a few runs. The game felt a lot shorter than Dragonfall. Also I miss gimmicks like the Schockwellenreiter or missions in which your crew is personally involved. You do not get that here (or I was too stupid to notice , but then again, I noticed in Dragonfall, where that was really well made). You also do not get to make as many impactful decisions or if you do, they do not feel impactful and I have overlooked them.  So, this review is a mess, but summing things up:  Pro  -Story itself is nice -Nice character, level and gameplay design -Artstyle and score -Well concepted runs  Cons  -Feels a bit empty (feel like DF had more runs, also no gimmicks like Schockwellenreiter or that secret dragon guy who always messed with you) -No really impactful decisions. It's like an action movie, you have your mission and with the exception of one or two cases, you just gonna stick to it. Of course you have freedom of how to achieve your goal, but you cannot change your goal. -Minor Bugs  Final Statement:  I had a blast with Shadowrun: Hong Kong. But it felt more like an Addon to me than Dragonfall did. A rerun with a different character might change that opinion, but I am not too hopeful about it.

They worked a bit on the HUD too and the textures seems a bit sharper (perhaps just an impression). Characters are engaging and the plot unfolds at a nice pace. Difficulty isn't challenging enough in my opinion thought.  Just finished it, the end felt a bit rushed but the plot was enjoyable overall. Finally, the shadowrunners backgrounds were globally interessant despite Duncan being annoying.

At the time of writing (v. 3.0.5) the game has it's share of bugs, but HBS has been on point with their bugfixes and have released patches following feedback.

There is no spoken dialogue, so a lot comes down to your own imagination. I know reading lots of text is not for everyone, but the dialogue in the game is well-written. If you allow yourself some time to follow the conversations between your character and the personas you encounter in a tumultuous, futuristic Hong Kong, the story  will  suck you in. The beautiful art style of the game really helps the story gain a foothold and the areas in which combat takes place seemlessly blend in with the surrounding environment. The music in this game is great and diverse, and in each different area of Hong Kong you will hear various background noises that make the game come to life.  When you are not busy delving into the rich background stories of your fellow Shadowrunners inside your headquarters, you can embark on missions (so-called Shadow Runs) that you can select via your mission computer. Each Run consists of completing verious objectives, such as kidnapping a target or infiltrating a building. Each mission contains plenty of turn-based violence for you to enjoy. Tactically positioning your squad is a must, for the enemy will try to flank your Shadowrunners whenever possible; increasing the damage you and your squadmates take. Combat is fun, challenging and dynamic, and there are often multiple ways to deal with your opponents: Be it engaging them from afar with heavy (sniper)rifles while your melee fighters sneak in to finish the job, using mages and riggers to summon powerful spiritual and robotic allies to wreak havoc from multiple directions, or even by jacking into the matrix (lol) to cripple the enemy's infrastructure before taking the fight to them head-on. You decide how you want to play.  Even when you are not much into reading the story, the game's combat system is challenging and diverse enough to encourage multiple playthroughs. Having the ability to create a completely different character that you can heavily customize by spending points in different skill trees will make each playthrough significantly different from the last.  The only minor point of criticism I have is that the choices you make often only have a minor impact on the main storyline. In an RPG, I would expect the (dialogue) options you choose to have a little more impact on how the story unfolds.

Cool stories, easy to use gameplay, straight-forward stats, good immersion.. It doesn't have the insane depth and hours of an AAA multi-million dollar game but the price tag easily reflects that and it is backed by Kickstarter (so it keeps closer to the designer/player vision than the marketing pitch). In short? Get this, and the previous one, and as long as they keep up the awesome work I'll keep backing them",

I'm pretty early on in the game, so this might be a result of low level play. Either way I don't mind too much. ",

The story is more personal than the previous two games becuase it deals with your PC's past and family. The companions side quests are pretty intersting and give great backstories.   It was good enough I'll play it again at some point, and I hope the next game mixes things up a bit to give something new with combat, and maybe expanding your HQ (always fun).",

Would be worth buying as an ebook for the writing alone, much less a beutifuly polished well mod-supported game. Also they made hacking feel less like a reskin of the real world and more suprise you are actually sneaking around like the digital theif you speced as. The studio commentary scattered throughout the game is also hilarious as they pretty much just sat all the team down to jaw about why Strangler Bao has a 4 foot Teddy bear by his bed, and other such wierdness. Which should pretty much be the reason you showed up to run in the shadows, but if you are a scrub like me to the Hong Kong setting, they do a horrifiyly good job at dribbling out info and atmosphere in game. Can not recomend highly enough.",

            "review_text": "This was the finest game in the series. I can't say that I'm always in the mood for the under-stated beauty of a somewhat retro top-down rpg, so I understand if some players aren't immediately pulled in. But when you've undulged in immersive, fast-paced FPS games, and you've also had your fill of strategic titles like Civ, Total War, and XCOM, this offers a very different kind of entertainment. And it isn't the kind of entertainment you get by claiming to play retro games from the 90s but really just sitting around drinking Pabst.   This game will drag you into its story. From the beginning, it pulls you into character stories and the dialogue appears to have lasting consequences. While its construction is decidely contemporary (in a good way) it still brought me back to the days when I cared about what other characters are saying and what I say back. (Baldur's Gate, Vampire Bloodlines, and more recently Witcher 3)  It's worth noting the totalyl fresh take on cyberpunk that Shadowrun Hong Kong takes. It sets you in the familiar world in a Chinese context of the future. The result is beautiful. Rather than run over ground that's safe and played out, it brings the player into a world that is both foreign yet close to our reality, similar to shadowrun worlds of the past, but different enough that it achieves that same exhileration one gets when seeing something brought to life in a new way, like in Deus Ex Human Revolution.   Another thing that sets this game apart, even from other Shadowrun titles, is the construction of the stories. They are far more varied than any other stories. While the game seemed just a little shorter than DragonFall, each 'run' really stood out with very unique situations. And I found the decisions came back later in the game (at least a few of them).  The cut scenes were done in taste, with both brevity and artistry. They really helped to bring the story out of what might be an otherwise dry experience that top-down rpg titles can be for contemporary players.  As for skill progression, that seemed well and good. Nothing to remark about - very similar to previous titles. I could be quite good in a couple skills. For me that broke down to this: strong but not particularly remarkable ranged combat, beat in rifles but effective with the pistol I ended up using more, expertise in decking, charisma for varied etiquette, with a solid Willpower towards the end just for story interactions). I played on the hardest difficulty and rarely had to restart battles, but I did have to play it carefully. The decking mini-game *is* worth mentioning though. It was a marked improvement on the other games - providing a unique approach that isn't just a carbon-copy of regular combat, and conveys the balance between speed, precision, and strategy that decking would likely be.  All in all, 9/10.",

            "review_text": "What you would expect if you played SR Returns and Dragonfall. Still a story-focused game with lots of talking and decisions to make, characters to develop and people to shoot. Whether or not you like the game will inevitably depend on the story...very subjective. The rest of the game is as you know it. Only some minor tweaks here and there. Decking got a complete overhaul and is now way more interactive and difficult. You're basically running around the Matrix in real time and have to avoid tracer programs. Get sniffed out too often and you trigger the alarm and have to fight a bunch of Reds or Blacks. Accessing a node now requires you to hack your way into it, by playing Simon Says repeatedly and then choosing the correct sequence of symbols out of a variety in a limited time. It's interesting, but gets stale quickly, since you have to do it multiple times on every mission, unless you just ignore decking, in which case you're an idiot imho.  Charisma finally unlocks ALL etiquettes as a certain race. And you can now lob back grenades, or at least one of your guys can...eventually. And the enemies as well, so be prepared. At least in the Bonus campaign this is possible. Speaking of which...this mini campaign adds a few hours to the base game. I'd say around 10 hours if you do the side missions and talk to everyone and play on medium, because ♥♥♥♥ me, they increased the difficulty by a whole lot. The problem is probably, because you import a save file and you're already pretty high 'level' with skills and gear, but your companions are still stuck at the same level. In any case the game likes to throw literally dozens of enemies at you in a single fight. This makes the fights tedious and very frustrating in my opinion. I've spent over 30 minutes on 1 fight. Actually most of the time is spent fighting in this expansion. And let's be honest, the fighting was never the strongest feature of this series. Getting SWARMED by enemies is not interesting or challenging, it's simply a boring way to apply immense pressure. Add to that time limits and all that nice stuff and meh. Really dislike the bonus campaign fights. Apart from that, character development is rather shallow and the story also doesn't really lead anywhere, so I'm not sure 'why' they decided to do this after-campaign. But they did...I'd say gameplay wise a 6/10, story wise I enjoyed it, but not as much as the first 2 in this series, so maybe a 7/10. Seattle and Berlin were more up my alley.  Technical aspects: Graphics are still the same, yet the game for some reason runs like ♥♥♥♥. Really long loading times and lots of stuttering. An SSD might remedy a lot of that, but it should not be necessary. Wasn't for the other games. Localization, at least English, is also full of mistakes. A LOT more than the base game has. Double words, missing words, misspelled words, you name it. You can still perfectly understand everything, but it IS annoying and feels a bit rushed.  Edit: Getting SOOOO ♥♥♥♥ING angry at the last mission in the Extended campaign. ♥♥♥♥ YOU, developers! You didn't need to increase the difficulty by 500%. Let's throw 2 ♥♥♥♥ing robots and 6 guys at you. Most attacks now stun your characters. Forever. Oh, you killed the 6 guards? Well, have another 6...and 2 more robots...so, you fight 4 robots!",

The party of characters are pretty interesting and well rounded, each one is well rounded and follows a philosophy - it's not about just being nice to each NPC.  Cons: It is decker heavy - if you don't like the whole puzzle/code thing you may get annoyed. It has really slow load screens, if you are having to reload a lot because you arent good at puzzles and codes (like me) then there are moments you will grit your teeth. Locking up at a crucial time is possible ...  Overall: It's a good turned based Shadowrun game. There are no major leaps here in graphics or game play from other Shadowrun titles but the story is strong and the characters are interested. Rarely did I find myself just clicking past the dialogue - I would recommend it to others, but damn I get tired of Decking ...",
