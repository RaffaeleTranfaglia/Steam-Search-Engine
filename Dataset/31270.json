The strange events in Scoggins will challenge every ounce of Tethers’ expertise, and possibly his very wits too, with brainteasers at every turn: mazes, logic...",

            "review_text": "First off, let me say: I come from a Professor Layton and Ace Attorney background. I live and breathe puzzles, but that's not to say that I'll take whatever I can get. My feelings towards the core factor of the game, puzzles, in Puzzle Agent are a bit mixed, but lean way more towards the positive end than the negative. Let's start with the negative. First off, some puzzle instructions are a bit difficult to understand or are surprisingly vague. However, this only happened to me a few times, and was far from the majority. Secondly, there were some jigsaw puzzles that, if you've played the Professor Layton games, are like the ones where you have to fit items into an area without them overlapping. There are a few here too, but it's odd in pieces automatically click together when placed correctly, and they STAY together, which greatly lessens the challenge. Those puzzles could definitely benefit from a better system, especially one where the general shape of objects were outlined and could snap together even if they weren't placed correctly. Other than that, I found the puzzles enjoyable. A few were quite easy, yes, but others took me a few tries and for some, I had to pull out a good ol' fashioned piece of paper and pen to plot it out Layton-style. Frankly, I don't understand how some people claim to have spent so many hints trying to solve them; I ended up using only 5 or 6 throughout the entire thing. There are 35 puzzles in all - I'll get to that in a moment - with 3 hints per puzzle, so with well over 100 hints you can imagine that 5 is far from a lot. To each their own, I suppose.  I've also seen people claim that the puzzles are placed erratically and interrupt the story, but honestly? I've felt that numerable times playing Professor Layton. That is the consequence of puzzle games. They WILL interrupt the story if you choose to do the non-plot-important puzzles, and even some of the necessary ones. That's just how it is. However, especially during the climax of the game, the puzzles begin to weave into the story a bit more cleanly than before, and in my experience, are appropriately some of the easier ones, so you can get through to the ending quicker without having to spend half an hour on one puzzle. I think the game's biggest downfall for me, personally, is LENGTH. It is simply too short. Like I said before, there are only 35 puzzles. The average Professor Layton has over 100. It only took me a few hours to get through the entire game, and it leaves you on a VERY unsatisfying cliffhanger ending. Granted, it does pick up again in the sequel, but it literally goes right from the climax to ending in the first, with practically no conclusion. It was surprising, to say the least. Once the credits popped up I said 'that's it?' out loud. I was genuinely surprised. It's a bit cheap to me to separate these two games when it certainly feels like it should be only one, twice-as-long game, but I have no played the second as of yet, so I have no info on how the story of that unfolds or if it is completely related. At the very least, there should be a package including both games so it can be one long, consecutive playthrough without people having to wait until they get money (i.e., me) to finish a story that should have been wrapped up already. The art style, characters, storyline (it's one of the 'out there' kind of stories, but it's strangely fun at the same time despite its absurdity), and audio are superb. Music matches the in-game events wonderfully, but don't distract during a puzzle, as it should. I enjoyed the protagonist and the supporting cast, and their voice acting was wonderful as well.  I fully recommend this game to new players of puzzle games, or veterans of the Professor Layton series. It may be a bit clunkier than the latter in some respects, but it is definitely worth a good playthrough. You're bound to get some enjoyment out of it.  EDIT: Oops, I believe there are actually about 37 puzzles in the game; I had missed two during my first playthrough. Also, I'm going to add that I am currently on my third playthrough of the game, and I still enjoy it. I'm going to add that the game is somewhat fast-paced, or at least the cutscenes are, so even though puzzles will be extraordinarily easy to solve, I'd recommend multiple plays because I've noticed several things that I didn't recognize the first time around, buuut perhaps that was because I was intentionally reading into things because I was analyzing Nelson Tether's character a bit. In any case, definitely worth another look at if you enjoy playing it. One final point I'd like to bring up is that of the somewhat 'rating' system assigned to the puzzles. Depending on how many wrong answers you give (resulting in the anger of millions of taxpayers) and how many hints you use, you get assigned a rating of sorts. Perhaps unintentionally, but hilariously, there is some pressure on the player to answer correctly on the first go, so you can expect to unconsciously triple-check your answers before you submit. It's really not something to fret about - at least to me, it's more humorous than anything else.",

            "review_text": "Puzzle Agent is an amusing puzzle game in the vein of the Professor Layton series on the Nintendo DS, where a narrative is played out interspersed with (seemingly random and often unrelated) visual puzzles which the player must solve. The puzzles are fairly easy (with one or two exceptions which are QUITE obtuse), and shouldn't cause most people much trouble. Furthermore, it's worth noting that the game is rather short, and the story ends rather abruptly (to be continued in the sequel). It's not a 'to be continued,' mind you, but....well, you'll see.  The story is....weird. It is to be experienced. It's kinda the point, and is rather surreal (in a literal sense). I found it amusing, but my sense of humor is nicely warped, so that's not too surprising. It might not be for everyone, but I'd recommend it.",

            "review_text": "Puzzle agent is a light adventure/puzzle game with a lot of charm and some imaginative puzzles, based upon the work by Graham Annable (which I was entirely unfamiliar with when I played the game)   Graphics &amp; Sound  Puzzle agent has a very distinct art style, one that I guess is a bit of a love it or hate it kind of deal. It's very consistent though, everything looks like it belongs in the world, and nothing looks out of place. Personally, I found the game to be nice looking, in its own peculiar way. The sound design also works well with what the game tries to be. The voice actors do a good job at portraying the different characters, and while there are no Oscar winning performances here, it works well. The voice acting also helps lend the game a lot of personality, which makes it memorable for more than just its puzzles.   Story &amp; setting  In Puzzle Agent you play as agent Nelson Tethers, who works at the US department of Puzzle research. There are trouble in the small town of Scoggins and their eraser factory, which supplies erasers to the White House. Thus your job is of utmost importance to the safety of the country. Scoggins is a peculiar place. Everyone is obsessed with puzzles, and not only that, everyone is also a bit Norwegian. Your job is to find out what is going on, and why there are pointy red hats seen everywhere. To make matters worse, the entire city is out of chewing gums, something that agent Tethers need in order to focus on his puzzles. This ties in directly with the games hint system, if you spend some of the gum you have in you've picked up you get a hint for whatever puzzle you're working on.   Gameplay  Gameplay is mostly straight forward. You click on objects like in a point &amp; click adventure game, gather talk to people, and quite often you're given a puzzle. These puzzles don't fit in as well with the world as something in say Syberia or The Longest Journey, but are their own self contained little entities. This does allow the game designers to constantly mix things up with new and interesting puzzles, but at the expense of some immersion. If you've ever played a Professor Layton game, you'll feel right at home here, the puzzles are handled in a similar way. And the vast majority of the puzzles are fun to solve.  Puzzle Agent is not a particularly lengthy game. The game can easily be beaten in less than 3h if you're comfortable with solving logical puzzles.   Final thoughts  Puzzle agent is an excellent little puzzle game with a really fun story, and some well thought out puzzles. At a base price of 5€, it's hard to not recommend this game, despite its short length. ",

            "review_text": "Puzzle Agent is a casual little 3-4 hour puzzle game that remains reasonably entertaining throughout, though it's a tepid sort of entertaining that I can't really recommend.  The puzzles themselves aren't very well scaled in difficulty, with both easy and trickier ones mixed together throughout, though none of them could be called challenging. Certain puzzles reminded me of SAT logic questions back from my high school days, so I suppose it takes a certain kind of person to enjoy them. I recommend using a notepad, since many puzzles with a logical process of elimination or others with more visual elements are made easier this way. The puzzles are also graphically unappealing - the in-game story / adventure sections give way to single static screens for each puzzle, without any moving elements (uncontrolled by the player at least) and an overall board game-type look.  The biggest problem though is that the puzzle design just isn't very good. A few puzzles have a set of 'rules' that must be followed to successfully complete them. Unfortunately, certain rules are vague and open to different interpretations, and others are entirely ommitted (unintentionally) and must be discovered by submitting an incorrect answer. An example of this would be a sequence of platform movements to build a bridge - ommitted rules include 'all platforms move at the same time', and 'platforms stop moving once they reach a destination'. I know that's a bit hard to visualize if you haven't played the game, but I felt like I should give an example.  In at least two specific puzzles I can remember, I submitted absolutely correct answers that followed every rule provided by the game, but were not the solutions the game was looking for. Those are disappointing oversights for a game built around only a handful of puzzles (just over 30). And there are 4 or 5 puzzles that involve assembling objects like a jigsaw - these can all be easily and quickly cheated without any effort by dragging a piece around the screen until it snaps together with another, and repeating until the puzzle builds itself.  Puzzle Agent's shortcomings in puzzle-solving are offset by the fact that there is no real penalty for wrong answers. They reduce your score, but perfect scores are not rewarded by anything at all, so no one save the most addictive completionists will care.  What elevates the game from 'bad' is the story, which I found charming and mysterious. I'm a sucker for the Mountain Town with a Secret kind of vibe. The voice acting isn't better than okay, and the game also struggles with its tone - it jumps from dark and mysterious to silly and unbelievable - but it's still sort of fun.  (At one point you distract someone pointing a gun at you by throwing a crossword puzzle at him, and he just can't help himself from filling out a crossword puzzle, can he? It's looney, I guess.)  Fair warning though: the game ends on a cliffhanger without revealing its mysteries, so it feels more like Episode 1 to the sequel's Episode 2 rather than a self-contained full story.  Another warning: Puzzle Agent 2 does not work on any Mac OSX released since mid-2013. This is not a problem that is likely to be fixed, so if you're strictly a Mac user, DO NOT invest any time into this game, since you will be left without the story's conclusion. This is another example of the Steam Store's lack of quality control, and Mac's terrible habit of compatibility issues with each new OSX release. Who's to blame but everybody I suppose?  So in short, there's nothing really *bad* about this game, but it's not great. Definitely not worth a full-price purchase, but if picked up on mega sale, it makes for a reasonable distraction when you have nothing to do.   5/10",

It was all about Borderlands and Game of Thrones, but I gave it a shot because I liked the comic book graphics.   -------------------------------(May be spoilers, BUT this happens very early!)-------------------  It starts of with seing the main character, Nelson Tethers sitting by his desk and solving crosswords and eating some bubblegum. He yawns and falls asleep. He wakes up by something walking towards him.    He wakes up and sees a big astronaut in front of him. The astronaut takes the crosswords and writes something on it. Nelson Tethers looks frightened and confused as he watches the astronaut. The astronaut stops writing and stands up. The astronaut starts to slowly take of his helmet. Nelson Tethers screams with fear as he is shown what is inside of the astronaut.   He wakes up screaming in fear and rips his crosswords apart, but calms down quickly. Looks around and there is noone in sight. He lookes down to see that there is some writing on his crosswords. He decides to solve the puzzle! A little quest thingy pops up and it says 'Nelson Thethers' crossword puzzle has been ripped to bits... but is there something written on it? Reconstruct it to find out.' When you are done with the puzzle you can see that it says    'SCOGGINS'    . You suddenly get a call. You get an assignment!

It is a bit old so the animation isn't much to shake a stick at but the best aspects of later Telltale narrative games (great characters, streamlined player interaction) are evident in this early effort. The puzzles are a bit easy at first but get more difficult as it goes along. If you like Professor Layton or any other puzzle-related point-and-click adventure games then you will like Puzzle Agent and its sequel.",

            "review_text": "Bought this game on a recommendation and played it in a night. It's a very quick, charming game, with an intriguing plot. Though the plot is somewhat whimsical, laying somewhere between Twin Peaks and Gravity Falls, it often does feel quite heavy and is always driving. The plot threads reveal themselves nicely, and the atmosphere, sometimes humorous and sometimes ominous, is well delivered.   However, I do think the game lacks resolution and feels like it drops a lot of what is happening very suddenly. Perhaps this is all addressed in the sequel? Still, I can't quite decide if the lack of resolution is affective or disaffecting.  Furthermore, this game is basically fully animated and voice acted with a unique look and feel. The acting is mostly good going on great. The choppy, sketchy animation style is tonally versatile and a pleasure to look at - furthermore the occasional moments of typical Paradox 3d visuals fit quite nicely.  Perhaps most importantly, the puzzles are often very fun, but sometimes initially ambiguously worded. They do ramp up in difficulty from simplistic to quite challenging, but I never found the puzzles annoying.  So, overall, very fun, incredibly intriguing game, much in the vein of Myst. Definitely worth it.",

Difficulty:  2 of the 37 puzzles i solved were a little bit more challenging than all the others. The others were just 'too easy'. And yeah, i played all Myst Games, so i know what i'm talking about. If you want to have 3 hours of light entertainment (more storytelling and some surprise moments    That red gnomes are creepy!    than puzzling) than this is for you. Other than i thought i really liked the game graphics, but that's only my personal taste. I'm looking pleased forward to play Puzzle Agent 2. But i dont think the games are worth the full price.  Pros: - light entertainment - nice graphics - all voices are crisp clear and gives evryone a personality - the puzzles are logical - nice atmosphere  Cons: - way too short - easy puzzles - gums are too easy to find - a few puzzles had no clear instructions (more like try and error, but prevented me getting a perfect score) - the end came too soon, i didnt expected it, the puzzles didnt get harder or gave me the feeling of a 'beat the endboss-challenge) - no replay value",

            "review_text": "Good premise, faulty execution.  Yes, the plot is rather silly, and serves mainly to tie the puzzles together. But since you bought a game called Puzzle Agent, presumably you're mainly interested in the puzzles, so that's okay.  Where the game fails is that too many of the puzzles are poorly described: either the rules, or the goals aren't clear. For instance, in one puzzle, you have to place tiles to form a path through a forest, to a goal, without meeting any monsters. Except that it's not enough that there be a monster-free path to the goal: none of the branches may lead to a monster, something that the game doesn't make clear. In another, you have terminals on a circuit board, and have to form an electrical connection between them. After banging my head against this puzzle for half an hour, I bought hints and learned that the electrical circuits already printed on the board were purely for decoration, and not part of the puzzle at all.  With some additional playtesting, and tweaking of the puzzle descriptions, the game could be much better.",

Puzzles are not very original or hard and there is a built in hint system, so there is no chance you will ever get stuck. The story, characters and music are all well done, and the game was very fun. My only real complaint would be the puzzle interface, especially the part after you submit the solution, that takes you out of the game world a bit.  There are some scary moments during the game, and if you like that kind of stuff, go to YouTube and check out videos by the author (grickle) like 'The Hidden People' or 'The Webb'.",
