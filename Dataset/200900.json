            "review_text": "It’s not easy to even start talking about Cave Story without starting to throw out such adjectives like “modern classic” or “cult underground hit”. But there, you have it, I just wrote it and I won’t take it back. This game preceded the current state of indie scene by a few years, back when it was released as freeware title in 2004. In a few years it was improved and expanded to various platforms with more content and refined graphics. It even was remade in 3D and published for 3DS, though that particular version lacks to provide definitive Cave Story experience. But in the beginning it was made by a single developer on his free time. His name was Daisuke Amaya. The fact that this guy is japanese (not that you couldn’t tell it by his name) explains a lot. Like, for starters, game’s setting and plot. Taking place inside giant floating island inhabited by giant sentient rabbit-like creatures called Mimigas this story is both absurd and complex. Starting out very light-hearted game is filled with tremendous amount of jokes. While the story develops, it tends to grow deeper and more brutal than you might think it’ll turn out. Like many metroidvanias do, game prefers not to present you with the world details and backstory, but rather let you explore it by yourself. A vague prologue, which will leave player clueless transits to waking up in a cave. A silent protagonist suffering from memory loss, as cliché as it is, works as perfect instrument here. You wake up, you find a gun, you begin your journey. Your mission, your ultimate goal is covered with the mystery. And discovering it can’t be done separately with finding an answer to an even more important question “What the hell is going on here?” But searching it won’t be similar to aimless wandering around. Cave Story keeps a very good pace, presenting you with new goals and providing directions to them on the go. It isn’t large glowing marker on the map though, but rather clevel organization of levels and progression of the story. Exploring and finding hidden secrets is present in the game, but size of the areas isn’t overwhelming and new levels are introduced one by one. There is though few very unobvious decisions that change the outcome of the game drastically. So if you want to achieve the best ending prepare to keep a keen eye for details or rather even look for some guides. From the perspective of game mechanics it’s the usual run-jump-shoot trio, but with a few twists. One of them is leveling system. Killed enemies drop yellow triangles, which fill the progression bar of currently equipped weapon. Fully filled bar increases weapon level, up to maximum third, but taking damage drops the bar back down, so prepare for some micromanagement. Weapons have different shooting patterns. There is Polar Star which fires plain bullets, then there’s Fireball which produces bouncing deadly balls of fire. Then there’s Spur which has chargeable beam; the longer you charge it, the more powerful the resulting shot will be. Plenty of choices results in very different strategies player can use. Though you’ll tend to have favourites among your arsenal, keeping them all leveled up and ready will be invaluable. To make things even more complex some of the weapons can be traded off in exchange providing you with other guns which have different qualities. This changes are sometimes mutually exclusive and not always reversible, so don’t answer yes every time some friendly NPC offers you something, that’s my advice here. Unlike your main interaction tools your character doesn’t really level up, with the exception of few valuable health upgrades. Not very hard if you keep the default path game is horribly ruthless when it comes to that last levels of the “best ending” branch. How does it sound for you: beating a few sequential levels swarming with enemies and two bosses? If you fail, you start again from the very beginning. That’s very different from the main path, where you’ll find save points after every major event. But then again, it’s for those who want to fully beat the game. For those who are trained and prepared there are even special timer for that last sequence, beating last boss before time runs out will unlock one of the few special music tracks in main menu. The themes depend on how fast you complete it, a new one for each minute saved. And that happens only if you found special secret item, but I guess that won’t be a problem for those who are that deep in the game. Cave Story stands on the shoulders of giants, combining elements from both Metroid and Mega Man. But it goes further than just simple copying of old classics. It is polished and compelling and its influence knows no merits; nearly every modern 2D-metroidvania has taken some lessons from here. A must-have experience if you call yourself a lover of modern indie-games.",

I got the freeware version on my PC, beat it again, and enjoyed that too. I even played it on my Android device and enjoyed beating it there as well. When I seen Cave Story+ on the market on Steam, I felt like I HAD to add it to my Steam collection by buying it, because, anyone whos finished this game and enjoyed it, can definitely say it deserves a buy. Multiple endings and a fair yet challenging general difficulty is more to ask for in a 2d shooter platformer, it even has extra content and loads of achievements.",

            "review_text": "I had played the original Cave Story back in 2010, when I read an article about it on 'Hak5'. I liked it 10 minutes into the game, and loved it by the end; when I had had experienced two different endings. 'Multiple endings! Wow!', I thought; and when I read more about it, I found out that there was one another 'best' ending, and some more hidden secrets that I was yet to discover. So I went back to the game, and I did. That was awesome, discovering something new about something that you are already in awe of.   A couple of years forward, I'm playing Cave Story+, with polished graphics, remastered and new music, new game modes, and what not; and I'm totally in love, all over again. Take my word for it, this game is awesome, you will enjoy it to the core. But, if you do like to read more on why I think so, here goes:      Your decisions, and there by your actions will have a bearing on the sort of a game end that you will experience.    You will still discover secrets when playing it for the 'n'th time, there by hugely increasing the game's replay value (provided you don't refer to something similar to 'Cave_Story_Secrets.txt' after the first time, or worse, before you have even completed the game; you will be very very tempted though, and hey, there's no shame in addressing a few guilty pleasures; I always do).     You will love getting lost in a fantastic 2-D world, with beautiful sprites and background art; an awesome score that sets the mood of the area and the situation you are in.    And at last, you will relish, and be in awe of the fact that all of this, from programming; to all the graphics, music; to the big fantastic story in its entirety (which gets revealed in bits, a lot of it through a lot of the characters who are beautifully woven into its strands) was originally conceived by a single guy (who aptly calls himself 'Pixel'). A SINGLE GUY!    Pixel's spirit is that of Hermit Gunsmith, (the drowsy creator of Polar Star; 'What's 'Polar Star'?', you ask! I say, 'Play the game and you shall know.') for he says a few words of wisdom, late into the game, that very much reflect the guy that Pixel is.   'There remains a very delicate balance in this world, between those who create and those who will experience the creations of others. I can't say that I wasn't aware of this. However, I had never experienced it. Now, thanks to you, I finally have. As long as the there is someone who will appreciate the work involved in creation, the effort is time well spent. To this end, I will continue to create for as long as I can.'   - Hermit Gunsmith; Creator, Polar Star &amp; Spur.         Time well spent...&nbsp;",

            "review_text": "So after years of occupying a place in my Backlog, I finally decided to give Cave Story a shot.  And I can definitely see why people adore this game so much. Playing the game, you can't help but feel the love and hard work put into it, and sometimes its hard to believe this game was made just by one guy.  You could easily place this game alongside indie darlings like Fez, Braid or Super Meat Boy, with its great pixel art and catchy soundtrack, and it's even more incredible to think this came out in 2004, before the indie craze even started.  Every corner of the game is polished and well thought out, so you never get the feeling you are indeed playing a freeware game ( Yes, you can play this game for free, this edition simply includes remastered graphics and soundtrack and some other extras).  As for gameplay, I would call this a '2D Ratchet and Clank', where you have an arsenal of versatile weapons to quickly swap inbetween enemy encounters and platforming segments. The game has a wonderful weapon leveling up system where you can get a stronger version of the weapon you are using if you manage to collect enough power up items dropped by enemies, yet getting hit enough times downgrades it back to regular form. This gives you a sense of feedback, where you feel you are getting rewarded for playing better.  Different kinds of enemies will have you constantly switching weapons in real time to deal with each situation as they come, and the bosses will always have you on the edge of your seat, dodging all kind of attacks and projectiles. You might get the sense at first that this game is a Metroidvania, but you soon realize that levels are very much linear, but there is a ton of secrets and easter eggs to uncover if you like that sort of stuff  The game is fairly accessible while still being very challenging as you go along, and for the hardcore crowd out there, you can try going for the True Ending where you are tasked with beating an incredibly hard level and a Final Boss all in one go without checkpoints, that alone will take you 2-3 hours minimum to beat, unless you are some sort of gaming machine.  As for the story, its a very simple tale that grabs with you with it's charming characters and setting, with a few emotional punches along the way. Nothing complex about it, but its enough to get you invested, and it fits perfectly with the genre and artstyle, and there is depth in it if you are willing to search for it It's very easy to see why Undertale was inspired by this game, taking into account the many parallels between both games.  I'd say definitely play it, you have nothing to lose( literally, it's free if you don't care for extra content). One of the best indie game ever made, and one of the best free games ever made.",

            "review_text": "The game is a re-release of Cave Story (Dōkutsu Monogatari), which was introduced 2004 in Japan by Studio Pixel. Later on it got translations into different languages, among them the english version by Aeon Genesis. The english translation in Cave Story+ is done by Nicalis. Now to the differences of these games: Cave Story+ has more content, these would be: - Variety of the difficulty level (Easy, Original, Hard) - Curly Story (main story with Curly Brace as the heroine) - Challenges (5 in total) - Two new dungeons (only to find in challenge mode) - Remastered soundtrack - Improved graphics  To the game itself:  The game is a 2D-platformer, which has rpg, action and adventure elements in it. The 8 bit graphics and sound are very well done and give you the feeling like it was back then in the NES 8 bit era. The gameplay is pretty good and the story makes the game enjoyable every second you play it. You are playing a robot who wakes up in a dark cave with memory loss. Stumbling towards a door that robot finds himself in a village in which the inhabitants are rabbit-like creatures called Mimiga. After hearing the Story of an evil doctor who takes away all Mimiga, the robot decides to investigate the matter and finds out that there's a bigger problem than just a few missing Mimiga. Actually the whole world is in danger and the robot is supposed to stop all evil. We all know that system already, the protagonist has to fix it all.   now my impressions of the game: positive: + remastered and original sound are both available (in most cases the original is in my opinion the better choice) + better graphics (which actually look pretty good, still the old graphics have their own charme) + curly story (even if it is the same story, it's fun to play with her) + hard mode and easy mode (hard mode for those who are searching for a real challenge, easy for those who play the game the first time - you need some time to get used to it after all) + challenge mode (for those who are searching for more challenges)  negative: - achievement-system is a bit broken (in most cases you'll get a major part but some are not to get due to this fact) - replay-function is buggy (broken replays are not what you want in a game after all) - you can only shut down the game via the main menu (the original game gave you this option as soon as you pressed ESC, i think they could have kept it this way) - after a completed challenge in challenge-mode the game will be closed (a bit annoying to start the game all over again) - the game will be closed as soon as you want to see ranks in challenge mode (that's what isn't acceptable, if i buy the game, then i want that it won't kick me out once i choose something in the menu) - in my opinion the english translation by Aeon Genesis was matching the game way better than the one by nicalis  But all in all the negative points aren't that dramatic, the game is worth a recommendation for all people who love classic styled games, a good and very interesting story and for those who enjoy challenges.",

The graphics is simple and a call back to older times but remains clean and stylised and doesn't feel like it's being lazy for the sake of calling itself 'retro', it's small cast of characters are well fleshed out for a game of it's genre, and despite it's cute and happy exterior things can get  pretty dark  at times.  With strong replayability and fun, fast paced combat I feel it's certainly worth the tiny price tag. In fact my only criticism is that Cave Story has only 5 dogs, compared to Undertale's 6     Did I mention you can sleep with a mimi... yeah, so, what're you waitting for? ",

The game is cryptic as all hell. If you do not follow an extremely specific list of minute tasks (don't talk to this person, talk to this person a second time, examine an object that doesn't appear to be examinable, make this really long jump without falling, don't follow this person until you get this item, etc) then you cannot get the best ending.   I am understandably upset, because even when using a guide, I missed one tiny little step (didn't talk to a person twice) and now the best ending is off limits on my current playthrough. I now have to start all over just because I missed one small step. This cryptic method of game development irritates me to no end and should be left as a relic of the NES era.   Putting all that aside, Cave Story is still one of the best games on Steam and you should buy it rapidly. I just wanted to prepare you for one of the big problems of the game.",

So I decided, why not buy CS+ as well since it was on sale?! And even though it's like my 3rd time buying it again, I don't think I will ever regret the purchase! Just the diversity and the play style which causes for a tad bit grinding and the punishment system of trying to teach you to not get hit and be tactical. It also has a kind of feel like the game itself is telling you to not give up and be a hero! I mean that is something you almost never see in video games these days.  It also has these really nice transitions of bringing you from upbeat to depressing and it really just shows how a real villian is supposed to act instead of just a clash of ideals and opinions with the whole thing between Misery(Absoloutley &lt;3 Misery she's so casual) and The Doctor(Just a downright jerk) going against Quote and Curly Brace. It just let you feel you were on a real cause instead of it just being a snuff game where the main character was mad the antagonist ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in his corn flakes. It even shows little things where the Villians start to step their game up and try harder instead of just refurbishing their same plan or just sitting back and watching you become OP.

Daisuke Amaya also known as Pixel made this game for 5 years during his free time which sounds great. You play the role of a unknown person who wakes up in the first cave, im not joking thats what the 1st level of the game is called. You lookaround the cave and 'steal' a gun from a guy who is sleeping. You soon find yourself in a village called Mimiga Village, a race of bunnies who are kidnapped from the doctor, not the one who helps you with your body i mean the one who kills you for no reason just to possess something. As you progress through the game you find a girl who was a human but got transformed into a mimiga ( dont worry only 2 people got turned like that, every mimiga is not a human) and asks your help to escape the island with her family. You realize you are on a giant island that was a piece of the surface (its not Earth). and that your a robot who was sent to the island to kill the mimiga but you got seperated from your partner and you forgot your name (its a stupid one but im not spoiling that much). Your job in the game is, find your partnet, save the mimiga, rescue the captured mimigas from the docter, kill the docters minions and himself and 1 more thing that affects the entire island. This game is actually harder than it looks as you find missle upgrades, health upgrades, new guns and most importantly, what you must and musnt do. There is 3 ending in the game, bad, ok and good ending. getting the good ending is hard as you must get certain items and not pick up items. I give this game 9 out of 10 because Daisuke Amaya really took his time to make an amazing game all by himself, the music,the gameplay and the graphics. The story gets more interesting as your progress through the game and the gameplay is equevalent to everyone well not the ending as it takes hardcore players to finish.

It is quite complex, story is rich, game has different endings, stages are nonlinear. It is really joy to play. There are even some RPG elements. Weapons are upgradable and they are quite different, so there is time and place for every item from your arsenal. Boss fights are hard, challenging, and most importantly fun. Just more checkpoints would be nice (some traps are instant death).  Highly recommended.",

Gameplay follows a metroidvania element, with environments stemming towards a free-flowing and fluid design that goes heavenly with the soft and twitchy movements that Quote can do. It contrasts a bit, further on, as you obtain the Jetpack, for it breaks the foundation that you maintained for so long, yet the game still makes it able to be introduced to where complications with it aren't lived for too long.  The story follows a set example of amnesia-cased shenanigans, which develops, with the implications and the history provided, into a depressing set of acts that can be only described as brilliant, once acknowledged.   The music fits to the criteria with every given situation, and gives an impact through the gameplay itself that makes it so that actions blend well with the mood of the environment, which gives the player a better understanding of the story without using cutscenes and text to remotely convey it whatsoever. The graphics themselves are sprites of olde time, but alongside the music, adds a vibrant flavor to them that seals the deal, throughout it all.  Although a free version exists, the creator deserves the money for what he has accomplished with such a cute game. It is certainly quite the story, that's for sure.",

The retro aesthetic worked well, and I found I enjoyed the game more when I switched back to the old style sprites (you can choose between old and new graphic elements, and old and new music in the menu), likely due to nostalgia. The game just feels like a forgotten gem from the 8 bit / 16 bit era.

It's unique story makes it really intesting to continue (Even though I'm not a story guy, I still admired it). It's technically one of those games that says: 'Screw reality! Let's go for imagination!', which 95% of all games doesn't do nowadays. Throughout you play the game, you'll confront different entities that you haven't seen before. The first ones are the Mimigas. They also play an important role in the game, so don't forget about them. Later on, you'll confront other types of entities. But remember this: You have never seen them before in your life.  It also have the feel of the old games. It's not really difficult like the old games but it has some of the thinking from the time. For example, there is bosses (Loads of them), no health recharge (All new games has that, and I think games are too easy with it), manual saving (Using save points) and so forth.  But there's one negative side with this game, though. And it's that the story is very involving. And if you know games: The more story it is, the less gameplay. That leaves the player with dialogs and cutscenes where the player doesn't do much other than watching things happen. And what I think about games are that gameplay is the most important thing. Because when I play a game I want to stay in control throughout the whole game. That's what I like with games like Snayke or Doom.  Still, an amazing game.

It wasn't a mind blowing story or gameplay but it was good and I see why for an indie game it got so much praise. Surprisingly for how much backtracking you do in this game, it rarely felt tedious.  I would recommend it as something to fill an evening. The game took me about 6 hours to complete.

This game has great retro graphics and good sound and music, good weapons and enemies, and solid level design. Retro platformers should always be welcome to any gamer with a brain. The only thing that killed this game dead in the water for me was the last battle. You have to fight 4 bosses with 1 life bar and a life full up jar, and it's not that it is hard that gets me, just pure frustration at it's worst. Trust me, beat the first 3 bosses with 1 life bar then use the jar for the final battle. That is your only hope. If you die, you have to do it all over again and go through all the dialogue. It will test even the most dedicated persons patience. There are no words to describe the frustration it causes. Don't get me wrong, I beat it after many tries, but the infinite frustration level still remained. Besides the last battles completely ruining it for me, I liked it.",

You need to defeat misery and the doctor and go back to an old house on top of the flying island then you will be stuck in the old house.  Then there is a little hole in the ground you jump down into called 'Hell' or 'The Sacred Grounds' Where you need to find Curly lying on the ground because she is hurt.  After you saved her and fight through all the mobs 'Angels' you gonna kill a mini boss that has a laser and where angels will come out of ground.  After that you will get into a room where you can see the last masters of the cursed hat thing.  Where you will get XP and HP back before the big boss fight with Ballos 'A SUPER HARD ♥♥♥♥ING BOSS HOLY SHIIT'!  It will take you around 1-5 days to make it.  I completet the game with normal weapons the most used weapon is SUPER ROCKET LAUNCHER it kills him fast! 'ONLY IN HIS 2-4 FORM!'  And after that you just got the best ending in Cave Story+! ",

            "review_text": "Cave Story is a well-known game for the people who know such things, and Cave Story+ is a slightly updated edition of that game. However, I am not one those knowledgeable people so for me Cave Story+ was a new acquaintance, and I started the game without knowing anything about it. This was very fitting, because you start the game inside a cave, not knowing anything about where you are, why you are there or even what your name is. Soon you realise that you are inside a huge floating island inhabited by a rabbit people called mimigas. They are in grave danger from a mad scientist, but you believe that you are there to help them. Eventually you start uncovering what is going on, and also who you are.  The plot in the game is rather intricate, so the motivation for the characters is not always obvious. I am not sure that the game constructor himself always knows why the characters act as they do, but since everything is done with such good humour I do not really care.  The game itself is a traditional run, jump, shoot and explore game. The control of the amnesiac main character are intuitive and well behaved. However, it turned out that I was a useless player. In order to progress in the story at a reasonable pace I had to give up my attempt on playing through the game in normal mode and restart everything in easy mode. This, embarrassingly, turned the trousers of the main character yellow. There is a nice selection of weapons that can be obtained through the game, and all types have their uses, so the trouser colour was not too much of a distraction for me in the end.  The graphics and the music are both gloriously retro and happy in style. However, I was surprised to hear Erik Lindström’s fifty-or-so year old 'Letkajenkka' being used as part of the soundtrack. He was sadly not credited in the end titles. This is not how you treat a composer of a catchy song!  Cave Story+ is a very fun game to play and, since there are many choices the player can make through the game and many secrets the player can uncover, it has a large replay value as well. I just wish that my playing skills were on the same level as the game.",

It's the kind of game where you can figure out what's going your way and what isn't, and adjust your approach accordingly. It also has accessible controls. Where I would normally avoid platformers on PC, this game is entirely playable on a computer platform.  The one thing I disliked about 'Cave Story' was how certain branch points were governed by choices that weren't possible to 'intuit.' For instance, getting the best weapon in the game and saving a certain character are prevented by simply deciding to do things that make perfect sense at an earlier time. I really am not a fan of fundamental gameplay elements being closed off by way of 'you need a game guide to figure this out, because you would never guess that this choice would be so Earth-shattering.'  Even with that major gripe, though, this game really is fantastic. It's a beautifully made nod to the old traditions of gaming, and its charm is really hard to deny.",

It took me a while to install it, and thats because I had fallen in love with the 3DS version, and even got the best ending, and even got to that point on hard mode (Still havent beaten Hell though)!  After installing Cave Story+, I found there is pretty much nothing differn't aside from the graphics update, and thats because its literally the same game, so it makes sense. Anyway I've got to say this is my prefered version of the game, and is the one I keep coming back to. Its the perfect blend of a great platformer, challenging levels, stages and boss fights, and many, MANY deaths. None of this is bad though, because no matter how many times I ended up screaming at the game, it just made me happy, that there is a game out there, that gives you an urge to beat it, the more you die.  So! If you like games that offer a good challenge, a bunch of weapons, a truly unique level-up system, and an addorible cast, then Cave Story, Cave Story+ or whatever version you want to play, is right for you!

Both the new music and graphics can be disabled, which is very good. Quote's new appearance is disappointing and I wish I could change it back to the original.  There is an actual menu now so you don't have to use a seperate program to configure the game. Generic gaming controllers are supported by default so it isn't necessary to fool around with a profiler. I recommend using a keyboard anyway. Still no mouse support for any of the menus but there is a custom pointer. There are hardly any display options. Just windowed, fullscreen, sharp, and stretch. No preset resolutions but you can just resize the window with your mouse.  Hard mode enforces a classic challenge to complete the game without picking up any precious health expansion items by removing them entirely. A good feature to have. There are challenge levels that you can access from the main menu as well.  Game was great. Now it's better and costs money.

The game I found myself playing had jumping. Soon there was a pistol, and then a rocket launcher. There were bosses and strange rabbit-like animals. I was having a blast. The controls were responsive, it had a nice skill ceiling, there were items to collect and I found myself somehow interested in it's simplistic story.  Cave Story+, an update on the base game (which is free, to my knowledge), found a niche I didn't know I enjoyed, and interested me to other games not dissimular from it. If I could level any criticism, it would be the arbitrary conditions required to get the 'Good ending'. I won't spoil it, but they can be rather silly.

Excellent bosses, interesting puzzles and the desing is awesome.   To be honest even thought I recomend the game, Cave Story was released as a free game by a Japanesse guy called Pixel. Cave Story+ is no more than the commercial version of it... new sounds electronic sounds (you can choose to listen to the original ones too, those are quite nice), textures polished a bit, a few modes such as time-run as well as some minigames...but thats it.   The game is worth playing, still speaking the truth, I cannot tell anyone to pay for what it is already free is worth the deal... It is all up to you.

The game I found myself playing had jumping. Soon there was a pistol, and then a rocket launcher. There were bosses and strange rabbit-like animals. I was having a blast. The controls were responsive, it had a nice skill ceiling, there were items to collect and I found myself somehow interested in it's simplistic story.  Cave Story+, an update on the base game (which is free, to my knowledge), found a niche I didn't know I enjoyed, and interested me to other games not dissimular from it. If I could level any criticism, it would be the arbitrary conditions required to get the 'Good ending'. I won't spoil it, but they can be rather silly.

There are many different enemies, all with different attack patterns, and all the bosses are fun to beat. 9 times out of 10 I would recommend this game to friends.  However, there's one issue - the endings.  I'm the type of person that doesn't really want to look things up while I play a game. I want to play the game, try my best to find all the secrets/powerups/etc., and if I miss a few, I'm fine with it.  However, if Cave Story, there are certain points in the game where if you do one thing over another, or pick up one item over another, etc. it will change the entire course of the game. I, not using the internet and not knowing this, played the game as it seemed I should play it, and got to the 'normal' ending.  And frankly, the 'normal' ending is depressing and disappointing.  Upon looking it up after beating the game, I discovered there were two more satisfying, exciting endings to the game, that I had missed by doing X during the story, and I wasn't about to go play the entire story again.  Cave Story's mechanics are good and the regular story is great until you get to the end. If you're fine with looking up walkthroughs and secrets as you play a game, I highly recommend this game. If not, I might think twice about getting Cave Story, as the ending will disappoint you.",

When you put the cursor on Hard, the word cancel changes to 'I'm too scared!' There are other funny moments in the game itself, as well as some touching moments.

Even from the start the story is interesting and the characters imaginative. I found myself wanting to know more about both.

I'll just presume you read the game description and cut to the chase. This is a high replay value action platformer taking high inspiration from Metroid. No, it is not Metroidvania, it's pretty linear. There are many different weapons to pick. Some weapons require trading weapons for others, some require you to combine 2, and so on. There are 3 endings for this game. Don't listen to what the description says, THERE ARE 3 ENDINGS. The first ending is pretty much the bad ending, it's more of a game over than anything else. The second ending is probably the one you'll do first on your own, it's not that hard to do and straightforward. The 3rd ending you WILL need Internet help from, there's a lot of weird things you have to do that you would never think of. This isn't that long of a game, and the freeware version is just the story, that's it. In this version: you have 3 save files for the story mode, 3files for a mode where you play as another character, 5 time-attack challenges, easy and hard modes, and improved graphics and music. Is the $10 worth the improvements? Yes! Should you try out the original freeware first just in case? Why not? It's free. Final note: this game is VERY hard for beginners. I recommend easy mode for beginners. Once you play as many hours as me, normal mode isn't hard at all, and easy mode is a breeze (once beat the entire game in easy on the second ending without dying once). hard mode is hard for everyone. You get no extra life capsules, and no rocket launchers. Very difficult. Sorry, this was more of a information ramble than a review. Anyways, this gets a solid 8.7 for me.",

There are several different weapons to collect during your adventure, and no, it's not possible to have all of them in one playthrough. The level design is excellent, enemy attacks are simple to learn but can still provide challenge, and while the art style and music are always up to individual preference, I've never heard anyone say that the soundtrack was anything less than excellent.

The game is good, people.  A word to the wise: the game is also difficult, even for a platforming buff like me.

Most of the songs in the 'remastered' soundtrack are fine, but not better than the original. There are added difficulty modes that just change the amount of health you have, and while the easy mode is good for inexperienced players the game's difficulty curve was already very well crafted in the first place. Hard mode just forces you to not pick up any health upgrades, something simple to do if you wanted to impose it on yourself in the original. The other extra game modes are not substantial.  At worst the 'additions' actually detract from the experience. One of the 3 optional soundtrack options is an abomination. The extra fidelity on the sprites is often a step backward: you can see a more of some characters' facial features but their expressions never change so it looks soulless. Their official translation often feels like it was trying too hard not to be the original fan translation, adding some cheap jokes and removing classic lines.   The only circumstance where I would reccomend you get this version of the game is if you want to support the developer who spent 5 years making the original and released it for free. Even then, I don't know how much money actually goes to him and not the company who took a free game and made a bunch of unwanted changes just so they could charge people for it.  If you do end up playing this version of the game first, play it with the included options for original soundtrack and art. You can try the updated visuals and music on your inevitable repeat playthrough, because you will love this game.  It's sad when the best way to play a premium version of the game is to emulate the free version as closely as possible.",

In addition to this, it seems that Nicalis has also decided to not put the game on anymore sales, and from what I have heard, there hasn't been anything done to the game content-wise that could justify this. In other words, Nicalis has decided to raise the price just to gain more money. I can no longer see any reason to purchase this version of Cave Story, as I mentioned in my original review (which will still be posted below this paragraph) that there isn't enough content to justify a full price purchase of this particular version. Instead of purchasing this version of the game, I advise that you just go and download the freeware version of the game, as you will be saving a whole lot of money just downloading the freeware version than by buying an overpriced version of a game that, while good, isn't worth $14.00. $9.99 was already steep, but increasing the price without even adding any content to justify it is pathetic. Don't give Nicalis your money.    ORIGINAL POST: Despite starting one of the worst trends in gaming (indie gaming, to be more exact), Cave Story is actually a pretty damn good game made by just a single person. Of course, with that being said, I suggest that you play the original freeware version of the game first before using your money to buy Cave Story +, as this particular version of the game isn't much different from the original freeware game, save for some bonus content and some minor improvements. If you do decide that you want to purchase this version of the game, do wait a little to see if it goes on sale, as I don't think that there is enough content to justify a full-price purchase of this version of the game.",
