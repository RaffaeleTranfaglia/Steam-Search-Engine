            "review_text": "Bought it , played it, beat it. Increasingly rare for me to say this these days, but this was a hidden gem that many will sleep on. Most will probably try to compare it to something like Balder's Gate/Dragon Age but it's more like Diablo where you control 4 people and can control then entire party. You can pause it and q up a whole string of commands and you will have to. This game is about combat and puzzles, more than NPC blah blah and that was a welcome mat for me, though the story wasn't terrible and the ending wasn't half bad. Only gripe is the game started out hard as nails and around the middle of the second Act it seemed impossible at times, then Act3 got steamrolled and I one shot the final boss... still though for 20 bucks or even waiting for a sale, is a steal for something like this. Was a really high quality game despite one crash, and a few niggles with pathfinding here and there. Given there's just not enough games like this, very easy to overlook. Hope for an expansion or even a sequel.",

            "review_text": "Aarklash is a combination of contemporary gameplay concepts packaged in a thoroughly enjoyable original game world. The real-time tactical gameplay may be paused for strategy and intelligent action queuing at any time, akin to Bioware's Mass Effect or Dragon Age series. This does a fine job of straddling the line between overwhelmingly reactionary (hardcore RTS) and drudgingly micromanagey (omg stahp, Sid Meier) to land in a comfortable sweet spot.  Core character roles are all familiar and easy to spot, ie DPS, Tank, Support, and perhaps overly so. While you can re-spec skill points any time you aren't in combat and sans penalty, nothing will change the pigeonholed duties of any single character. Different characters do, however, provide equally different approaches to those roles. Your high-armor taunty starting tank feels utterly different from the high-HP drainy tank introduced later. Your AoE stun battlefield mage DPS is wholly unique from the fear kiting AoE burst damage lich DPS. Skill points can dramatically change the implementation of a skill. One skill tree path alters a targeted taunt into an aggro-stacking aura, as an example. Balance is maintained well enough that I never found myself forced into a specific team for pure efficacy, and I appreciated that, too.  Aarklash's (Aardvarks?) visuals and style are also quite original. The graphics avoid eye bleedingly generic, but never so artsy or stylized that anything becomes abstract. The audio always feels appropriate and organic, managing to be pleasant without standing out in most cases. I never had any 'just walked into Gestahl's Magitech facility' moments, here.  Most characters deserve genuine emotional investment. Dialog (with decent voice acting) and individual foibles are believable as well as interesting. The giant, ruthless, kangaroo/lizard-booty'd, test-tube grown, magical cyborg miner-slave-become-indentured-bounty-hunter, armored tank girl just happens to  also  be everyone's sweet, caring, occasionally naive, gentle voiced, younger 'sister' stand-in and I never questioned it once. The people on both sides of the over-arching power struggle had no clear moral high ground. Your heros and their guildmates are emphatically not 'good' people but neither are they evil. Their motives are usually easily understood but subjective morality is a significant factor for precisely nobody. Both protagonists and antagonists are driven by a combination of geas'd contracts, pseudofamilial loyalties, and outright selfishness.   The story was quirky, unless the last paragraph didn't make that obvious, but ultimately disposable. The developer did a great deal of world building and complex background development... then slapped a generic 'run from the crooked law and find the macguffin' Hollywood plot on top. There was not a great deal of character growth either, which I felt was a real shame.  I had a lot of fun playing the game and would cheerfully play it again were an iota of reason to do so present. The downside from the flexibility of free skill respecs lies in there being no real point to starting over to see how a totally different build would handle the game's events. Equipment is just random stacks of minor stat boosts, rarer items simply having more picks from the general pool of boosts and higher levels providing slightly less minor boosts. There's no real grinding, collecting, or optimization to be had here by the hardcore gamer.  Aarklash: Legacy seems to have suffered from a lot of player butt-hurt stemming from a steep difficulty curve. The game is challenging in the classic sense. That said, nearly every party wipe I experienced was perfectly preventable without any foreknowledge if I'd more closely observed enemy stat boxes and spell countdowns. The gameplay tutorial even stresses that the player  must  be attentive to these resources. I felt combat was entirely fair with reasonable demands on my decidedly average skill level. The game is first and foremost a squad-based strategy RPG. If you go into it expecting a pick-up-and-master casual or arcade game you're going to be brutallized, and deserve it. I felt it was slightly more forgiving than Final Fantasy Tictacs (PSX), if simply for the fact that the most devastating boss actions are interruptable or redirectable while mid-cast.  Overall, I'd have to give the game a 7.5 out of 10. The minimal replay value and disappointing story were the only serious downsides. The musical score, while inoffensive, was also inconsequential. Where Aarklash really shines is in the moment; during a dicy moment in combat or affectionate banter between morally ambiguous guildmates, the time just flies by.",

I liked the characters, but the voiceovers were mediocre to awful. Plot doesn't really exist, and the loot is incredibly boring.  Also the game did it's best to murder my GPU via overheat.

On higher difficulties regular use of the tactical pause is required for aiming and timing of abilities. Enemies must also be analyzed during combat to counter their spells, repositioning, and what not.  Other than that levels are pretty linear, but include the occasional secret a little bit off-road, as well as an increasing amount of puzzles, the further you progress.  Classes and abilities are quite original for an RPG, and seem thought out well.",

And yet there's is something special in this game, that makes you keep going and repeat those failed battles, wonder about character progression and spend a lot of time on choosing the best equipment.  What I loved about this game the most, was the difficulty. Man, did I curse a lot, I can't even count the number of battles I thought were impossible to win, and the feel of accomplishment, when I was able to push through.

This is the kind of RPG that could be amazing if handled correctly but for me the combat doesn't quite work. Otherwise, it's a pretty solid game, and at least the devs tried to do something different. It play a bit like a Diablo style game - with four characters - or like Krater with 4 instead of 3... hope they balance it out a bit better - or change the combat so it's not just swing, swing, walk out of the way of an attack, swing, swing, try to use magic - oh, gotta cancel and walk out of the way of another attack.

While you can change their function by realocating skill points (yay skill trees!), it's not what I would strictly call character customization. There are tons of synergies to find between various characters/skills and the game does expect at least some situational awareness (switching between skill variants based on what sort of battle you'll be in next, etc).  The story and characters didn't stand out much, but I found myself enjoying them regardless. I did manage to get twenty solid hours out of this game.

Each character has four abilities that you can put skill points into though at max level you can only get two of the skills maxed out. You can respec at any time though, so no worries about putting points in the wrong area. I love that this game has fair combat. No cheating PC baddies. You enemies may have different abilities but you can view what all their abilities are at any time in combat, with the exception of two bosses i believe who were listed as having some secret abilities. You know what your party and the enemy party are capable of, so it's a matter of using your abilities best to crowd control, counter, and kill the enemy. Great game at a fair price.",

You have no chance (sometimes in the skill tree the skill can cancel something) to undo it...you can only prevent it...but to be honest I don't know if enemy curse me in 5 or 10 sec...
