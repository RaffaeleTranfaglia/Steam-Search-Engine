            "review_text": "EDIT - Below is my original review. A small patch has come out which has sorted the dim light out at the beginning. I have now played a lot of the game and I previously said it was a 'good game' - I now think it's a 'very good game' for Â£8 - helpful developer as well!   'Good game, well made, thinking Man's psychological horror that you need to persevere with. What I mean by this is: at the beginning of the game, the first building (out house) is quite dark and the phone torch to view the game to do what needs doing is frustratingly not good enough (IMO needs wider beam) - once you're past that part things are easier and the game get's better. The game is not an action horror game more like a tense, suspense horror game that requires thought to move on - you feel rewarded once you sussed something out. My wife played the game and really got into it - she wanted to finish it which she nearly has - well we think she has as we've been playing the game for more than 3 hrs and we're still not at the end yet, the game is described as an 1 1/2 hour game - maybe we're just thick :) Aside from the odd gripe, the graphics for VR are good enough and no complaints about the audio. Maybe not for everyone but, if you like these sort of games you may well like this so I'll recommend on that basis!'",
