            "review_text": "I know we're all still distraught at the senseless loss of Silent Hills, but I'm starting to suspect that P.T. will have sooooo much to answer for...   At least the developer of this game/demo had the good sense and common decency to make his product FREE. I've certainly wasted good money on worse excuses for 'horror' games on Steam. It even manages to be passably impressive for the first ten minutes or so, even though walking around in random circles in a confined series of rooms waiting for the next spooky thing to happen barely qualifies as either 'story' or 'gameplay'.   The game is even smart enough to release you from the repetitious prison of a mere handful of rooms and a couple of corridors PRECISELY as the gimmick is starting to wear a bit thin, only to deliver you into the hands of...one of the single most infuriatingly shithouse 'chase' sequences you will ever have the exquisite displeasure to endure. In spite of there being absolutely no indication of which direction to run in, I continually found myself at a computer console which I had to 'hack' with the aid of a seemingly randomly-chosen keyboard letter (!), all the while being swiftly chased by one of the stoopidest-looking monsters I have ever witnessed; who would surely have been impossible to outrun if he didn't have such a ♥♥♥♥ing knack for running into walls and catching himself on the edges of doorways. Five or so cheap deaths later, and I for one was done. Nice try, though.   I'll happily give credit to the dev for doing a better job than most of his European Unity cronies, but if you've played many of the games I'm referring to, you'll know that's no great feat. Steam might be seriously suffering from a lack of quality control of late, but that's no excuse for aspiring devs to not police themselves (just because you 'finish' a game doesn't always mean that you should release it). Still, as I say...sigh...at least this guy didn't charge us any money for the experience. Only your time runs the risk of being wasted, so I guess you don't have THAT much to lose.   Mind you, it's a good thing I've never actually sat down and calculated just how many hundreds of hours of my life I've wasted on glorified demos which failed to deliver: now that would be a TRUE HORROR too shocking to even contemplate! And H.P. Lovecraft thought he had a raw deal...  Verdict: 4.5/10.",

            "review_text": "This game is free but that doesn't mean it's the game you're looking for, unless you're looking for jumpscares and can shrug off the design flaws. The pacing is bad, you'll see the jumpscares coming from a mile away and the atmosphere is mediocre. The art design doesn't really follow any particular theme with the environment feeling awkward and hastily assembled. The threat isn't scary and the monster is stereotypical, his animations are also bad enough to make you giggle. Also, good luck pausing the game if you need to for whatever reason because not only is the game implied to be played in one sitting but it has no pause menu to speak off.  In short, if you want cheap jumpscares for free go ahead, but if you're expecting anything else don't bother. If this is the developer's first game, as it appears, then it's about what anyone would expect so hopefully they'll try to improve on these flaws to produce something better in the future.",

The maze/hacking part and the platforming bit right at the end were kind of awful... But hey, the dev said he'd take those out of the main project. Besides, it's free, and there's nothing to lose.

            "review_text": "This is a very short game, should be completed in one sitting. Anyways, there are only 2 parts of the game where you have to really... 'Interact' with the story. (SPOILERS) One of those parts was when you had to be chased by this hilariously-running guy who sais 'come here' every time he gets too close, and as he's chasing you... you're suppossed to 'hack' these computers that are hidden around a small in-door maze to open another door that leads to the next part of the story. The other part of the story that is 'interactable' is a jumping course. But, there are 2 paths to this, one leads to another teddybear and the other one (closest to the light that is shining on the jumping paths/blocks) leads to the exit, which will spawn another set of jumping courses, though only one path.   * Not too hard, most of this game is just walking in circles around the house until something happens, or something is out-of-place, at least up until the interactive parts of the story (there's only 2). Jumpscares (including sounds) are a temporary scare, nothing too extreme like most games (in which, may dissapoint many players due to this game being a horror game). As I said before, this game should be completed in one sitting (35 to 50 minutes depending on how fast you play).  PROS: + You can run! + Gameplay is overall OK + You're living a nightmare (seems that way due to the story because you keep waking up) + Graphics are ALRIGHT, but not great.  CONS: - Little Jumpscares (nothing extreme) - No subtitles at the end of the game, like in the beginning (?) - Walking in circles for an hour, waiting for stuff to be triggered or the lights to be turned off. - little interaction with the story.",

Sound is implemented well which is needed for a horror game to shine. This game mixes the walkabout flavour with a certain aspect of danger; almost Outlast like. Worth all the 30-45mins of gameplay. Just couldn't work out what to do with that safe though.  Sure the logic isn't 100% but hell - I still enjoyed playing.  I will agree that some parts where control is lost, and long periods of waiting is painful, but I see that it's a way of building tension. I'd say that's the only negative.",

            "review_text": "I didn't hate this but I didn't love it either. It was interesting to me, though! It has some creepy moments - and if you like atmospheric horror with some jumpscares, it's worth at least a little of your time, especially as a freebie.  But I'm not writing this as a review for other players - I mean, it's free, you can't complain too much if you hate it. This is more directed at the dev 'cause I think there's a fair bit of potential here - and, after all, it is a game made to harvest reactions.  I'll be writing spoilers after here, if anyone wants to avoid them!  --  The atmosphere and tension within the first house portion was pretty decent. It set up some good world building, and things moving when the player wasn't looking set up for some creepy moments - I really like that, feeling as if, maybe if I'd looked over my shoulder quick enough, I might have been able to see the monster? I know logically that's not possible within the constraints of the game, but the feeling that it was near was exciting. I felt like you were trying to emulate P.T.? And that's a really good starting point for inspiration honestly.  The monster itself had its good moments - it making noises and lurking just out of sight was good, kept me on edge. The model for it was kind of weak up close, though - so seeing it in full light and up close just made me giggle a bit. And that bit where it peeked around the door was just comical. Even with a stronger model, though, it's a lot better if you don't see the monster up close near the start, if at all. Fear comes largely from unknown, and being confronted face to face with what you're dealing with may startle the player, but after the initial jump, it's a lot less frightening.  The computer bit was... awful, honestly. The lead-up to it was great! The long corridors reminded me of House of Leaves, and the boiler room was menacing. But the level design in the computer room was overcomplicated and frustrating. Too many rooms, not enough distinguishing features to help you remember where you're supposed to go. The fear level just plummets after that. Repeatedly seeing the monster, laughing at the monster's movements, and getting killed by the monster, only to be reset and have to attempt it again just weakens the game dramatically. It would have been a lot creepier if the monster was present, but not chasing you, I think. A lurking presence, one that you're aware of through sounds and shadows, is far creepier than one that confronts you head-on.  Then, back in the house, things get creepy again. The house was definitely the game's strongest point, although I suspect there was a lot of delayed timing, which got pretty frustrating after a while. Waiting without knowing whether or not you're actually supposed to just be waiting, or if you're supposed to actually be doing something, doesn't add anything.  I liked the end - I'm not a huge fan of coma stories generally, so having that as the big reveal didn't do much for me, but that's personal preference. Going abstract with the consciousness platformer, though? I dug that. Falling off the ledges was kinda frustrating though - maybe making that a bit easier to deal with would be an idea. Or even just having the character reset back to the start without the loading screen? It would feel more like a dreamstate that way, kind of disconcerting.  I think, to the dev, the technical things you need to look at are pacing and level design. Otherwise, you have a lot of good technical knowledge in place, it just needs fine-tuned.  You'd probably benefit from another writer on your next games, if you can find someone to collaborate with. Someone to read over the premise you have and add their own thoughts and feedback, to give it a bit more depth before you get to the stage of actually even making the game itself.  On a horror level, it would benefit you to sit and think what actually scares you. The parts that were actually scary preyed on the fears of the unknown; fear of the darkness; of unseen and malevolent forces; of things being out of place in your own home and not knowing why; of not knowing what you're supposed to do; of being trapped. The parts that weren't scary were big goofy monsters with chainsaws. But why did you put it in? Are you afraid of monsters? Or are you afraid of death? Are you afraid of pain? Are you afraid of something larger than you taking away your agency? Or did you just think other people would like it? I'm not giving you a right or wrong answer - you're the only one that knows what scares you. And you can't make a scary game just catering to what other people like - you have to know for yourself what you're afraid of and why you're afraid of it.  Play good horror games. Play bad horror games. Take notes on why things did and didn't scare you. Read and watch horror, too - taking inspiration from other mediums is vital to keep fresh. And play similar games from other genres, too, that have similar mechanics. If you haven't already, check out some popular walking exploration games and take notes on what makes them fun. I'd recommend taking notes from The Stanley Parable; Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald; Gone Home; Dear Esther; The Path. You've probably already played Slender. Especially with Stanley Parable and Dear Esther, try get your hands on the original versions as well as the final releases - they're free online as they're mods of HL2 - and compare them with the final releases to see what they changed and what they kept or refined.  And I wouldn't spam any of your future games with elements just because you feel like they're good gimmicks, either. Like, the teddy thing? Did nothing for me. Collectibles are cool in some games but the way it was presented just didn't work, and if you're focusing on a story like this one you're less likely to be looking for stuff to collect, especially if it holds no value to the gameplay. If you want to keep it, maybe making things a bit more subtle would save it.  Also, aesthetically, I liked your house design a lot. It wasn't just bare, there were enough decorations to make it feel lived-in. I would advise if you're making another house level in future games to actually add more of that - the more it feels like a place someone actually stays in the creepier it is to have a monster moving around in it. It's a juxtaposition that's really unsettling, I think! The boiler room, too - very nicely done. The steam was atmospheric as heck, and the whole lead-up to it with the wallpapered rooms was creepy, and kind of a jolt in change of scenery. It felt surreal, and I liked that.  Overall, you have talent here - don't get discouraged by negativity in reviews, please, because as a feedback-gaining exercise, this has been a huge success for you! I look forward to trying out any future games you come out with, and I hope you can take the things you've learned from this and implement them even better! Plus, disregard people getting mad about it - people who don't make games don't understand just how much time and effort it takes even to make simple things. While the game isn't perfect, it shows that you've dedicated a lot to making it. I don't know if this is a profession or a hobby for you, but it doesn't really matter - if you enjoy it, keep on going and make things that you love :) I hope this was helpful - sorry it turned into a bit of a wall of text! Good luck, and thank you for the game!",

I didn't like having to wait for 5-10 minutes in order for something to come up and scare me, because i was randomly going all around until something happens. I liked the system on the basement where you had to hack some computers and having the chase on your head by the creepy guy. I kinda also liked the part with the jump on white blocks thingy but i would like it to be more creepy or let's say having a small jump scare video. Last thoughts for a free to play game i recommend it for everybody. BUT if you are really weird and you want a free to play game to have the options of an outlast or an alien isolation i think my friends you ask too much.",

It relies pretty heavily on jump scare payoffs, but there is enough variety in how they are set up and presented that I was not put off.  Usually short games get ♥♥♥♥ on for being short, but I think it is usually a very good decision in cases such as this. Minds Eyes gives you the experience it set out to communicate, and it didn't overstay it's welcome. It's well worth the time investment and it's free.   Additionally, as a professional Unity developer myself, I can partially appreciate how much work went into this experience, and I wish the developer well on the next project.",

You beg for something different.After getting drunk multiple times you decided to drive home. Your wallet is hungry for attention but you don't notice. It's not until your amazon package arrives that you check your phone. Lights blare as serveral glass shards are emitted into your stomach. Screams are thrown and blood is hurled. Your leg snaps backwards and you fly out of the windshield. Your body hit's and rolls against the cold wet ground as you slowly wither away. You like this feeling of nothing. You like the release of pain that it gives you. You want more but you can't have it. It won't let you. Everything turns to black. Silence. You hear nothing. You see nothing. It ends.",
