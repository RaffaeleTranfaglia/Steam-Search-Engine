At the Big Science after-party celebrating the capture of Splosion Man, a spill of champagne shorts out the safety protocols on the splosionatrix and from it emerges Ms. Splosion Man.

            "review_text": "Rating: 8.5/10 Status: Awesome    What is it   Ms Splosion Man is a precision based platformer that will test you skills.  The Good: + 45+ Single player and Multiplayer levels + Great variety in each level, you will splode off speed barrels, regular barrels, timed walls, moving platforms, ride rocket cards and zip on railings. The developers made sure that every level provides something fresh to test your platforming skills + Great challenge, each level introducing new concepts and builds upon it through out the game. The first few levels are easy but as you move further along things become increasingly difficult + Lots of good platforming puzzles in each level, good satisfaction when you figure out what you have to do.  + Great artwork and graphics  + Lots of Arnold Schwarzenegger movie references  + Possibly one of the strangest endings in video game history.   The Bad: - Multiplayer community is dead so you won't be able to play any of the multiplayer levels. Their is a mode however that lets you play with one controller however this is very frustrating and is not the way the levels were meant to be played, still it was nice of the developers to include it - The game can and will be frustrating at times, this isn't necessarily a bad point against the game per se but if your a gamer who gets frustrating easily, you may want to avoid this game.   Conclusion: I loved this game and if you have the patience you will too. One of the best platforming games around.",

            "review_text": "This is a tough, but fun platformer. Its funny, and enjoyable. You can play a few minutes each day and be done with it. There's no need to play for hours at a time.  You can replay levels, there's a multiplayer option, which I haven't tried. There's separate endings for single and multiplayer.  It does use GFWL, I hope it gets patched out before GFWL is shut down in July.  I purchased it for a bit over $2 and have it on the XBOX 360 as well *won it in a McDonald's promo.*  It's not as hard as Super Meat Boy, but it is hard. It has checkpoints in the game though.  If you like hard platformer games and have a wicked sense of humor, its worth buying.  ",

Pros: - Can be very challenging and somewhat rewarding when you get things going - Puzzle elements are fun - Lots of levels  Cons: - Sometimes it feels like you've died a bit cheaply - End game doesn't really offer anything new apart from challenging levels - could've offered something like upgrade able abilities or more techniques to solve puzzles - Secret exits are cool, but it's annoying you have to go back through the same level where you found the exit to continue on  Game can drag a little bit towards the end, but it's a good platformer!",

The female-stereotypical (i.e.: sexist) humor was kind of disgusting, even if it was deliberate. And the boss battles were dull.  But the levels themselves are very well made. They are varied enough to not be boring, and the difficulty is just right (not Super Meat Boy hard, but hard enough).  If you grew up playing Super Mario Bros. and have a hard time finding decent modern platforming games, you should give this one a try.  8/10.",

Your money is better spent elsewhere. The gameplay can't compare to the sheer number out there today. Also, the humor is funny during the intro and ending, in-between it's just obnoxious. I recommend muting and playing your own music over it.",

What were they thinking?!  The game's okay, it really would be better if I'd used a 360 controller but via a keyboard it did work albeit less than ideal. However, the GfWL addition is enough to make me feel as if I'll never return to it and sooner or later will 'delete local content'.  Shame.",
