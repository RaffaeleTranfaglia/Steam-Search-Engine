The characters look good and my elf has gone through a lot in the two villages and I must say that I enjoyed it. I love how my friend and I bought the wizard's tower and we live up there. It's a very good moment. I highly recommend this game to anyone and I mean anyone. I give this game a 9 out of 10. I just love the game.",

The games community are a great bunch that are welcoming to new players and some will be more than happy to help you. The game has some bug problems when it comes to pvp, but they are mostly caused by the difference in ping. The music in this game is very good, if you want to listen to something relaxing Syrtis is good for that. Alsius is a more up beat celebration music. If you want to listen to something evil then Ignis is good for that.  if you can look past the bugs and the graphics (the graphics are actually ok and besides you should never judge a game by it's graphics, it's the gameplay that matters) then you will enjoy the gameplay and the community",

            "review_text": "This game has a horrible playayer managing system per realm vs realm, one realm can have 50 players to each other realms 1-5 players online. Which gives them the ability to run the game and get every upper hand possible all the time.  Secondly this game is EXTREMELY under staffed, the Staff that rarely does come on has no more power then to kick,ban or mute playes on the server and any problems,bugs or errors you get with the game, your account, or anything you bought and payed for is either ignored, un-resolved, or when the ADMINS feel like doing something about it.  I do NOT recommend this game to anyone, and strongly advise them and their friends not to waste their time or money with it.  Personal Experience: I purchased a 54$ guard pack for this game and they made me wait 2 weeks to even be able to use it when it should be instant activation upon purchase and entering code.(This was not the case)Also you CANNOT be REFUNDED.",

First you must level up, armor up, learn spells (for warriors, archers and mages) for your weapons. Later though you fight people to win over forts, castles and other areas. Grinding may be annoying though.",
