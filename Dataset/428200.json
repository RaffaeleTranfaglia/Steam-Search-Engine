            "review_text": "I'm a fan of RTK (Romance of Three Kingdoms), so this totally appeals to me. Furthermore it comes with very nice artwork, funny dialogues, and awesome music (definitely some parody here).  Gameplay is easy to learn, and I had lots of fun trying out different combos on my first try. In short you bring a max of 4 characters with you from stage to stage like an arcade game, and earn 'coins' along that way, which can be used to upgrade your characters to unlock additional skills to be used for combos.  I'm definitely sold here. Great game for a great price. 8/10  FYI, I'm playing it using chinese traditional, and via a controller.",
