You manage group of people, giving them orders and goal of this game is simple: survive as long as you can, everytime you start the game, you get different people with different experiences in different places. Manage them to survive and watch out for their relations. Everything they do is written in diary, so you can think, what to do in next turn 9/10",

While you're never really IN the game itself (smashing zombie's to pieces) you control what goes on; Make 'Kin' watch for zombies, while 'Jine' makes ammo. There's skill levels; One star to five stars (though without making custom content, I've never seen anyone go over 4 stars) There's medicine; 'Jine' threw a chair at 'Kin' and broke his arm. (The wounds never fully heal while I play, but you can turn off survivors hurting each other) There's noise; While 'Jine' is making ammo, the noise attracts zombies. There's custom content; Want a superawesomemegazombiekillingmachine? I did. I made one. It uses pistol ammo, while being a sniper. My survivors also modified it so that it's a shotgun as well!! You can also make custom survivors (AMAZING!!!) There's rain; ...the rain should dampen the noise. There's random events; A woman with a shopping cart came by today. She says she'll trade ____ for ____ You can make notes and signs on the map; Cross out a place you've looted and moved away from, circle and note down your base. You can ajust difficulty SPECIFICALLY; How many zombies per in-game hour flow into the city? How much ammo is scattered? How many zombies in the buildings to start with? How much food? How much medicine? There's hunger. Survivors rest after working for some time.  THIS GAME IS JUST AMAZING!!!!!!!  Oh, Pro Tip: CHESS SETS ARE DEMONNNNSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!",

Looking back, I'd say the $10 I spent on it probably wasn't worth it. If you can get it for about $5, I'd say that's a fair price, but it just feels a little un-polished. Still giving it a Thumbs Up, because despite all that, it's still a reasonable game, as long as you can keep your survivors from breaking each others limbs.

This game is one of the finest zombie survival games I have ever seen. It plays more like a text based adventure, so there is a lot of reading, but that just adds to the flavor. You control survivors trying to accomplish some sort of task, Survive/Fix a vehicle/Escape, and each challenge is its own difficulty. You control what they do, where they go, and it's just a blast. Nothing is more harrowing to send a survivor off to check a house and find that some helpful person left a map and a crossbow just lying around. I reccomend this game fully, it's one of my new favorites.",

            "review_text": "I highly recommend this game, but you should know that it is not for the faint-hearted. This game is only for the 'rough and tough,' those individuals that would actually survive the days after the 'zombocalpse.' This game is one that requires thought, planning, and a balancing act between the attitudes, skills, and oftentimes prejudices of survivors. Something interesting to note is that a survivor's personal bias isn't represented by how another character appears. Example: A survivor might be racist, but that isn't related to the randomized picture of the survivor. While I played, each survivor was different, with different skills and abilities, and frequently the stockpiled items weren't always the same. In one game, I had a solitary character who was distrustful of women. As it happened, a woman showed up who happened to be distrustful of (and not attracted to) men. They were able to work together, though, and after they got disgruntled with one another, I was able to spread a rumor (but since there were just two of them, more like sharing background) that had my male character think more highly of his female co-survivor. There were times when the game didn't seem very intuitive, but there is an online 'step-by-step' manual offered by the game designers that I found helpful. After playing I also learned that although there were tasks I could have my survivors work on, I didn't need them to work '24 hours a day.' Rather than constantly be making noise building more and more barricades, they could quietly reinforce their position. And the game was 'warning me,' but in a roundabout manner. I think this is an incredible game and the interactions between characters, tasks, and difficulties are quite reminiscient of a very popular American television series with similar themes that as of this writing (10/23/2015) is now in it's sixth season.",

            "review_text": "If five racists die after spending 3 hours fighting with each other, does anyone give a ♥♥♥♥? This is the question posed by ZafeHouse Diaries as you are placed in charge of guiding a group of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to safety in the midst of a zombie apocalypse.  Zafehouse: Diaries certainly had potential and is enjoyable at times but the game is bogged down by questionable design choices and clunky in-game mechanics. Add onto this the fact is that there are now better games available that offer a much more fun experience like Rebuild.   The game IS a lot more enjoyable if you import your own characters into the game, since this is the only way you'll be able to inject any sort of likeability into your survivors. I mean, who wouldn't want to see if Hulk Hogan, Pope Francis and Wolverine can survive the apocalypse? However, doing this disables acheivements, so you'll be s.o.l. if you want to form an emotional attachment to the default group. The default group and their biases are randomized, and you'll be stuck with a random racists, homophobes, bigots and sexists. As you can probably imagine, this doesn't exactly endear them to the player right off the bat. Add in the virtually non-existant character development that occurs throughout the game, injury debuffs that never seem to go away and a penchant for NEVER coming through in the clutch and you will still not care about them when your survivors all die after playing for an hour.   At the start, you have to try and effectively manage everyone by both playing to their strengths and avoiding conflict with each other. However, one well planned rumour can make your life a lot easier and it's entirely possible to get everyone to like each other by the end of the second day. However, conflicts will still happen on rare occasions and your survivors will get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about inane ♥♥♥♥ like having to wait to take a shower or not having anyone play chess with them.  Dora from JayIsgames put it best when she said, 'You have nothing to go on other than the simple formula of incompatible traits, and it feels less like tempers reaching a boiling point and more like a bunch of variables behind a computer screen flipping you the bird.' Sadly, this 'bunch of variables flipping you the bird' is not limited to the relationships aspect of the game.",

            "review_text": "No strategy involved, it's a game of chance. You can barricade up a house, modify all your weapons and armor, breach a building that only 1 zombies been spotted in and end up fighting a horde of 20 that slaughter everyone. You can't retreat, you can't make any decisions in combat, you just read what happened that turn. On the other hand, sometimes a single survivor with a bat will kill 9 zombies on patrol.  All you really do in this game is look at the map, give up to 5 people orders such as being a lookout or search the building. You can also secure a building, this is about as in depth as the strategy goes. Once your done with the building, travel to another location on the map and hope your people don't get massacred when they arrive. Also, an annoyance, each survivor can only carry a few pounds... So 5 survivors might only get to carry 16 lbs of items. Traveling back and forth to move items from a secured house to your new secured location is very tedious and without much reward.  The game has not been updated for a couple years, the forums seem empty, and the game is buggy. The programming in it seems very old, it doesn't autosave and saving/loading is not intuitive. In fact the GUI is quite lacking but since it's not very complex it's pretty easy to figure out.",

In one game, within the first couple of turns a fight broke out between survivors and the only one in my crew with fighting abilities somehow lost to the musician and came out of it with a broken leg, making him pretty much useless at what he was supposed to do. In another, a fully loaded police officer, with upgraded pistol, rifle, and armor, died to two zombies. This isn't 'hard,' this is a game that does an RNG check to screw you over. The choices all feel superficial, and while I have not played a ton, it really seems like the best strategy is to split all your survivors into separate houses and just not deal with the drama.",

He shot and killed 7 before they killed him. Mitchell was gored, trampled and killed by 3 zombies. He shot and killed 2 zombies before they killed him. That was breaching an 'empty' building after investigating it and arming the only two who got along from the initial 5. Either zombies kill your group, or their hatred kills them. In the end, everyone dies, nobody cares.  8/10 for idea. 1/10 for execution. You have fully equiped characters with plenty of weapons and armor and they still  die...why?  Because they hate each other. Ultimately this game is ruined by every character hating every other character. Even if you make them all friends, it's only temporary and the next time someone wants to play chess, they hate each other all over again and without cooperation, the groups all die.  I tried this in beta and it was ok, now having purchased it I see how they ruined the whole idea and abandoned the game in favor of creating a sequel. Is a sequel necessary for a game this bad? No, don't think so. The devs would have been better of making this more enjoyable. Instead you have a game where there's a couple die hard fans voting it up while everyone else votes it down. Instead of honest reviews, you see there is no latest reviews option since the latest ones all vote it down.",

You don't exactly need to spend 10 hours programing to add in a couple variations on flavor text. But you will read the same few pages every game over and over again.   And it's almost all pointless anyway. Every character boils down to 'Here are his stats, here are the races he is a bigot towards.' In fact, I don't know if this game was made in the 1960s south or what, but the assumption is that the minute zombies show up everyone will reveal incredible racism and sexism which eventually bubble over and destroy us. Ends up making everyone 2-dimensional.   This is a cool concept and I think it has potential, but you'll get bored of this one before you ever get close to the end.",

In leiue of supporting Zafehouse they have opted to make 'Deadnaught' a clausterphobic game in a completely different Genre. - Non-customizable screen resolution, 'experimental' options that Crash the game! Break your desktop wallpaper and even break applications running in a dual monitor setup! - Seemingly no autosaves! When the game crashes, enjoy the total loss of progress that ensues! If there is autosaves it's likely as poorly written as the rest of the game.  Summary:  Zafehouse diaries is a game that COULD have been fun if it was written by competant coders who cared for their customers. If you expect this game to run on any form of modern hardware you're likely expecting to much. If I were to to break the game down into categories I'd rate it thusly:  1 - Terrible 5 - Excellent  Content: 3 - Characters act like children most of the time, however managing them and taking on the zombies can be real fun, add to that the gamble that is exploration and the game is a reasonable amount of fun, that is if you could actually play it.  Graphics: 1 - There is no resolution option, they do give an 'Experimental' display option, that essentially changes your monitor's display resolution. If you think this sounds like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ implementation of resolution then you're right.  Audio: 4 - Audio is fine, nothing groundbreaking but it seems to be (relatively) free from bugs.  Final Thoughts:  ScrewFly Studios should be renamed to 'Screw You' Studios. At least it will reflect their attitude towards supporting their games. ",
