            "review_text": "First off, don't expect this to be your run-of-the-mill tower defense game.  This game focuses heavily on resource management and plays more like a hybrid shooter/tower defense. The tower cost scales up quickly so you can only afford to place a few strategic ones to back you up. The rest you have to shoot down with projectiles/missiles/bombs manually, and every one of those costs resources. So this is not one of those place towers and watch things die TD games. It is more challenging than most TDs, but has an interesting balance. I found it to be quite enjoyable, though frustrating at times in a type II fun sort of way.  The developer is very active. Just today I had an issue with the game, which I posted on the discussion board. Someone on the board picked up on it, notified me that the developer was offline at the time, that he has forwarded this to him. The issue was acknowledged, responded to on the board, solved, and patched within 24 hours of the issue being posted on the board. For an one-man-show developer, that is impressive.  In short, if you're looking to try a new TD hybrid that is challenging, I would recommend giving this game a try. It's a fun indie game with a developer that I feel is worth supporting.",

            "review_text": "No problems/bugs encountered so far. The game itself has a unique concept where you have to fend off invaders by using a combination of different weapons, each with its own advantages and flaws. Stronger weapons have, in general a longer cooldown, etc There is often a delay between firing and the projectiles actually hitting their targets, so smart aiming and predicting your targets\\' movements is essential. It is based on the tower defense gameplay but unlike most tower defense games you dont just place them and wait what happens. You have to actively destroy your enemies.",

It gets easier as you get into the higher levels of upgrades, and I yelled in frustration a little, but it ended up a great game.  The level of difficulty is pretty intense, though.",

Artificial Defense is a very cool, compact Tower Defense Game with an unique style and dynamic gameplay! The high complexity of the gameplay and big variety of functions can be confusing in the beginning, but after a few games I got used to without any problems.  The player is forced to pay attention to the whole map and needs to switch between classic TD elements and offense abilities. Between the games the abilities and towers can be upgraded and extended. The game is designed for TD Lovers, but due to the offense abilities it has its own gameplay that differs completely from standard TD Games. This property also determines a challenging difficulty even for good TD Players.  Graphics and Soundtrack have a very high quality and fit the gameplay perfect.  This is one of the best Indie Games I played in a while, because of the accurate work on every aspect of the game: Gameplay, Soundtrack, Graphics, Interface Design",

Different enemies, different structures to build to help you survive, and different modes. This game is made by one single man, but the overall quality is top-notch. I can't wait for the more brilliant ideas of mixing games genres. Definitely a must-have for any strategic-games lovers. Big thumbs up.",
